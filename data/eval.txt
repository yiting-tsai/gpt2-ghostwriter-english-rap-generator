Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!
Don't cry 
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go 
(Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie 
(Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, whoa! 
(Don't cry, don't cry)

Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, "dun-dun-dun-dun-dun"
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, "It's just you and I"
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

Don't cry 
(Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go 
(Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie 
(Don't cry)
, I fuckin' love you, whoa!

Don't cry 
(Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go 
(Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa! 
(Don't cry)

Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise
 
 
 
Yeah, I put my shades on

I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high,
 but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside,
 
MOB
 
Piru Damu

Light that Ashton Kutcher,
 I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises

If you ain't got a lighter, what the fuck you smoking for?
We hot! (Haaa)

What the fuck, though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough  guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a shit show, put you front row
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches, and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go, where's the uproar?

What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, woah
Puff, puff, bro; I don't huff though
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
"Knock, knock. Who's there?" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so
What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro
We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go?
Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
‘Cause all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker

So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive,
 murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I can pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove
I just stand up and scream: "Fuck 'em all!"

Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes;
 got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole
My confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—

Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

Cut the music up
A little louder

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, 
couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love

Hey, Mr. Carter

Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say "Church!" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

Hey, Mr. Carter 
(I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world and I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching

(In case you wonderin', hah!)

Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: "Wayne quit!?"
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic?
 
I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream "Soo-woo"
 and 
"Da-da-doe"
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

Hey, Mr. Carter 
(Young! 
I am him
)

I'm right here in my chair with my crown
 
and my dear
Queen B,
 
as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' 
the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs
 
and the Marleys
 
and the Marcuses
Garvey;
 
got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom!
 
The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot,
 
while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much 
change
 from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter)
 Young!

It's my go, yeah
… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter,
 
Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, "What up, killa?" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

Hey, Mr. Carter

(Chyeah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
 
 
 
Pump that bass

Man, fuck ya'll with a sick dick, semi automatic, no click click

Young Mula
Truk yo girl

Uh, my mind’s filled with mine fields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It’s Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yea, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain’t never lyin' yea
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
The end of time is like a hour away

Damn, military minded, lost and can’t find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there’s food for thought then I’m guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea

Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what’s appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch? I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don’t play, boy, I ain’t Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It’s a cold world, I put on a mink
There’s a chain of command, I’m the missing link

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
And I’m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?

It's alive, it's alive, I'm revived
It's C5, been arrived, kiss the sky, did the time
Please advise, it is advised to be advised, and we advise
You not fuck with me and mine, and keep in mind that we don't mind
Losin' our minds, free your mind, read your mind, read your mind
Body take a week to find, the cops gon' be like, "Never mind"
What's on your mind? Put the pistol to your mind and blow your mind
Control your mind, mind freak, no sober mind, I'm so behind
But front line, you crossed the line, and you better know your lines
And if you gettin' out of line, I hang you with a clothin' line
Wring you like an open line, keep your stanky ho in line
Them hoes be lyin', it's a thin line, and I know you know the line
Second line, second line, Tunechi got effective lines
Rough edges like a box of Checkers fries, that's a line
Catch the line, American flag, less stars, extra lines
Stretch the line, skip the line, 'til you no more next in line
Yeah, Tunechi-Tune a lunatic, my goonie-goons the gooniest
Run inside your room and kill you and who you roomin' with
The Uzi with the booty clip, more than one, I'm too equipped
Talkin' 'bout some fake niggas, based on true events
Tryin' not to get pinched, smokin' on a stupid stench
Lookin' in the mirror tryin' to figure where my pupils went
Flashy with a boujee bitch, Travy, that's my hooligan 
Take the T off Tunechi and look at it as the crucifix, bitch

C5, best rapper alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let it fly
 
 
 
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say, now I'm raising you and
 
ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you
(errr!)

You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen (Yeah)
When all of the lights, they get low (Low)
And all of the curtains, they close (They close)
You cannot break down (You can't) what can't be broken

G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes
G-code (Can't be broken)

I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You emulate, I'm laughing in your face
Now fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil' a day
For like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

You cannot break down what can't be broken 
(G-code)
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Uhh)

G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes, 
G-code
(Can't be broken)
 
 
 
(Glory)

Woo, this that shit they didn't want me on
I'm 'bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lamb', I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in a wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little gals
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweler ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, "cock-a-doodle"
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you (Glory)
Glory

I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-hoo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I'll sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, "Surprise," but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely when sortin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord

Am I talkin' crazy? Too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, "Be quiet, we need our privacy"
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, hook you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's cruisin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em

Glory, hallelujah (I got 'em)
(Glory)
I got 'em

Ain't no collective bargainin' on cocaine
So in other words, nigga, do your thing

Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop-pop-potato salad
 
 
 
She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools

Coconut Ciroc

I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not forever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for "Fuck you"

No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches
 
 
 
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did

But baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

I'm good, I'm not living like I did before
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, said I'm good
Oh, I been good
I've been out there puttin' down that work
I'm good, said I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, motherfucker I'm good

This is dedicated to everybody who forgot
Forgetful motherfuckers
Remember, don't you remember?
I been good, we good

Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em

President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses

Amen, so now instead of pledge, we pray, yeah

President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech

Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, 
Thank you, thank you all, I am President Carter

Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi – niggas don't appreciate you (don't appreciate you)

Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow, and to say, too
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school

3 Chainz, oww

Caught up in my bullshit, put your head on backwards
And skate off after, engage in laughter 'bout what just happened
Fingers in napkins get sent to mammies, is that too graphic?
Catch you in traffic, you sitting Daffy like stealing candy
My ceiling’s absent, my wheels are massive, my friends assassins
All of us bastards, our mothers queens and our women dancers
My rivers rapid, my fins are splashin’, my gills are flappin
’
I bit some matches then sipped some gas and went kiss a dragon

I’m really rappin’, no finger snappin’, I’m pistol packin’
Y’all niggas slippin’, my swag is drippin’, so here’s a napkin
What’s really happnin’ bro? 
Verbal attackin’, I’m showing passion
Know what I mean, see I’m the king like I’m from Akron
I’m going overboard, somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks, I always want the fat ones
I’m so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer

Too many bitches, too many blunts, too many buttons
Not enough bullets, them niggas buggin’, the SWAT is comin’
AK on shoulder, no shoulder shruggin', aim at ya nugget
My weed sticky like acupuncture and magnets, honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin' like Kappas stompin', I'll slap a junkie
I’m having lunch with Italian Sonny, don’t ask the subject
Lord, why you took Rabbit from me? He say, "Don't ask me nothing"
Too many bodies, 
too many bangers
, too many bundles
Not enough bullets, these niggas buggin', I heard they stung you
It’s gon' be trouble, we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga, don't even mumble

I’m back to ballin', I'm in the back full of magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready, turkey spaghetti and caster oil
That's codeine, turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In four minutes I'll turn this into forensics
In a foreign car with a foreign broad
 that’s long winded
Paper long and you taking long, you just don't get it
Hung the phone up on Satan, told me he want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi in summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
Get pulled over for swervin’ like, "Hi, officer"
When he ask me why I was swerving, "I’m high, officer"

I can make it bounce by myself

I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle
I play the shadows, don’t play no games, I straight get at ‘em
I’m on the chronic all day like it’s my favorite album

A plate of salmon, the Cayman Islands, a stripper dancer
If I don’t get the car first, I’ll have a temper tantrum
I’m innovative, I demonstrated, this nickle plated
I don’t care if you owe me a nick, nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady, eat her pussy then kiss the baby
Get situated, get keys off table then leave her 80
I really made it, 
get it maid, Schwarzenegger
Won’t wrestle niggas, I spatula all you action figures

I’m so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls, they say fuck yeah

I’m doing this shit like whatever
When I go I’mma leave for the better
I told her you dig like a shovel
I want a Ferrari in yellow
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches
I been a playa since elementary
I got more bars than a penitentiary
I got a clip that hang several inches

I can make it bounce by myself

Stop what you're doing, let's toast
Mista magic mountain, now she wanna overdose
Flo Rida do the most, that's a statement under oath
This train on fast approach to pick up Natalie La Rose
Let's go!

Bought a ticket for the ride
But I can't turn back now, I'm inside
Oh 'round and around it goes
Where it stops, nobody knows
I'm addicted to the climb
You can hear my heart beat double time
Make me blush, give me vertigo
Can't stop, I already know

Oh, you lift me up, make me spin around
Yeah, you hit the breaks and then bring me down
I touch the cloud and fall back to the ground

I don't know, I don't know why
But I love to ride your roller coaster
I don't know, I don't know why
But I love to ride your roller coaster
Oh, oh-oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh
Oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh
I don't know, I don't know why
Your roller coaster ride

I'm a victim of desire
Cause your body sets my heart on fire
Yeah, you know how to move it right
Back and forth, take me through the night
I'mma stay here by your side
Wanna keep my hands inside your ride
Gonna make it to paradise
All the way take me through the night

Oh, you lift me up, make me spin around
Yeah, you hit the breaks and then bring me down
I touch the cloud and fall back to the ground

I don't know, I don't know why
But I love to ride your roller coaster
I don't know, I don't know why
But I love to ride your roller coaster
Oh, oh-oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh
Oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh
I don't know, I don't know why
Your roller coaster ride

All access to my up and down, up and down
Flo Rida express got you addicted now, spinnin' 'round
Roller coaster crazy girl, said you wanna go faster
Fast and furious when I take them curves, another chapter
Hold up, get ready for the climb
The way you sell your sexy, while I let you skip the line
So we can share this theme park, your body any time
The perfect place to scream cause you know it's going down

(I'll ride your roller coaster)
You pick me up, take me anywhere and spin me 'round
When I'm with you I ain't never gonna hit the ground
You pick me up, take me anywhere and spin me 'round
Roller coaster
You pick me up, take me anywhere and spin me 'round
When I'm with you I ain't never gonna hit the ground
You pick me up, take me anywhere and spin me 'round
Roller coaster

I don't know, I don't know why
But I love to ride your roller coaster
 
 
 
If you respect me, don't protect me
You can tell me, I can handle it
Stop pretending cause we're going down
If you let go, then just let go
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
Never ending, kinda round around

I lied to my heart cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire, if the candle's melted
No you don't have to love me, if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better

Unkiss me, untouch me
Untake this heart
And I'm missing just one thing
A brand new start

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la

Can't erase this, can't delete this
I don't need this, I can't handle it
I just feel it, that you're over us, oh
If I wait here, if I see you
It won't matter, what's the point of this?
We're in pieces, because you're over us, oh

I lied to my heart cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire, if the candle's melted
No you don't have to love me, if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better

Unkiss me, untouch me
Untake this heart
And I'm missing just one thing
A brand new start

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la

So baby, let go, gotta let go
It's disrespectful, I can't handle this
Never ending, kinda round around

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la

She wakes up early every morning
Just to do her hair now
Because she cares ya'll
Her day just wouldn’t be right
Without her make up
Never out of make up
She's just like you and me
But she's homeless, she’s homeless
As she stands there singing for money
As she stands there singing for money
As she stands there singing for money
In my sleep I see her begging
Preaching, please
Although her body's not mine
I ask now why, god oh why?
She's just like you and me
But she's homeless, she's homeless
As she stands there singing for money
As she stands there singing for money
As she stands there singing for money
She's homeless, she's homeless
As she stands there singing for moneyThree little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon
So sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Oh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside
(just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hairdo

Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

'Twas more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

Oh, you're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
 
 
 
Just like a star across my sky
Just like an angel off the page
You have appeared to my life
Feel like I'll never be the same
Just like a song in my heart
Just like oil on my hands
Honor to love you

Still I wonder why it is
I don't argue like this
With anyone but you
We do it all the time
Blowing out my mind
You've got this look I can't describe
You make me feel like I'm alive
When everything else is au fait
Without a doubt you're on my side
Heaven has been away too long
Can't find the words to write this song
Oh...
Your love

Still I wonder why it is
I don't argue like this
With anyone but you
We do it all the time
Blowing out my mind
Now I have come to understand
The way it is
It's not a secret anymore
Cause we've been through that before
From tonight I know that you're the only one
I've been confused and in the dark
Now I understand

I wonder why it is
I don't argue like this
With anyone but you
I wonder why it is
I won't let my guard down
For anyone but you
We do it all the time
Blowing out my mind

Just like a star across my sky
Just like an angel off the page
You have appeared to my life
Feel like I'll never be the same
Just like a song in my heart
Just like oil on my hands
 
 
 
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh take me back to the start
Oh take me back to the start
Oh take me back to the start
Take me back to the start
 
 
 
Laying in the grass in the afternoon
Something kind of magical in sunlight
Flowers uncurl in the garden
Shoots are coming up again, it's springtime

It's new like the day I saw your eyes
Green like the leaves unfurling up against a blue sky
Blossom leaf falls in a slow dance
Swaying got me in a trance, so high
It's all green, all new, and I want to spend it with you

Lost in your wonderland
Green aphrodisiac
Kiss me, your lips taste of honey
Songbirds and bees start a-hummin'
Come to my wonderland
Green aphrodisiac
The same thing that grows in the garden
Flows in me and you

I want to go where all the rainbows start and flow

Just when I thought it was not to be
Holiest of mysteries, it's all green
And everything that I have planted has grown
And all it needed was time, earth, water, and the sunlight
Down to the middle

Lost in your wonderland
Green aphrodisiac
Kiss me, your lips taste of honey
Songbirds and bees start a-hummin'
Come to my wonderland
Green aphrodisiac
The same thing that grows in the garden
Flows in me and you

I want to go where all the rainbows start and flow
How could I know it was Sunday?
How could I know you would take over my mind?
I want to know where all the flowers unfold
Cause I know that
The same thing grows in the garden, flows in me and you

Aphrodisiac, green aphrodisiac
I want to go with you
Where it's green and all the flowers grow
All the water flows, all the memories go
Just for the afternoon, ooh baby

Aphrodisiac, green aphrodisiac
Kiss me your lips taste of honey
Songbirds and bees start hummin'
Oh, out to the garden
I'm, I'm foolin' around with you, oh, oh
I want you there
When I get out
And the grass is wet and the lilac is in the air again

You (na na na na na)
Oh (na na na na na)
Oh, ah-ah (na na na na na)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
 
 
 
I know what I said was heat
Of the moment
But, there's a little truth in
Between the words we've spoken
It's a little late now to fix a heart
That's broken
Please don't ask me where I'm going

Cause I don't know, no I don't know
Anymore
It used feel like heaven, it used feel like
May, I used to hear those violins playing
Harp strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away
Nobody wants to face the truth
But, you won't believe what love can do
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you

Went to the old flat
Guess I was trying to turn the clock back
But, how come that nothing feels the same now
When I'm with you?
We used to stay up all night in the kitchen when
Our love was new
Ooh love am I a fool to believe in you

Cause I don't know, no I don't know anymore
It used feel like heaven, it used feel like may
I used hear those violins playing harp strings
Like a symphony now there gone away
Nobody wants to know the truth until their
Hearts broken
Don't you dare tell them what you think to do
Until they get over, you can only learn these things
From experience when you get older
I just wish that someone would've told me
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you
 
 
 
I don't want to give you up
I don't want to hold you up
I don't want ambiguous
I just know that I've had enough
I want you to travel with me
Let it loose and let your mind go free
Show you things that you've never seen
But you just got to go with me, oh
Your love is so good that I want to show you
Don't make me responsible
For something you that can't find, ooh
Your loving is so good, so good, the closer
I want it, I want it into me
I want it, I want it, leave it here
I want it, I want it
I want to get closer to you, baby
Experience
I want it, I want it, generous
Lay down what's impeding you
Cause I wanna get closer to you, baby
I don't want to give you up
But I'm tired of the pull and push
I'm tired of the making up
Don't you feel like you've had enough?
I want you to journey with me
Explore all the innocence
I don't mind us to build tension
But we've got to move in the same direction, oh
Your love is so good that I want to show you
Don't make me responsible
For something you that can't find
Ooh, your loving is so good, so good, the closer
I want it, I want it into me
I want it, I want it, leave it here
I want it, I want it
I want to get closer to you baby
Experience
I want it, I want it, generous
Lay down what's impeding you
Cause I, I want to get closer to you, baby
I wanna, I wanna get
Wanna, I wanna get closer
Oh, you just got to go with me, oh
Your love is so good that I want to show you
Don't make me responsible
For something you that can't find
Ooh, your loving is so good, so good, the closer
I want it, I want it into me
I want it, I want it, leave it here
I want it, I want it
I wanna get close to you baby
Experience
I want it, I want it, generous
Lay closer
I want it, I want it closer
I wanna get close, I wanna, I wanna get close
I wanna, I wanna get close, closer
I wanna get close, oh yeah, baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby
I wanna get, wanna get
 
 
 
When we first collided
The timing wasn't right
I showed you the signs
You disappeared into the shadows
Now you're back again
Telling me you do
You do
Don't you recognize a fellow astronaut?
We've been here before
Our movements are elliptical
And when you move towards me
You make me lose my cool
It's cruel

I've been to the moon, don't tempt me
I've been where you are, God help me
I've been to the moon and stars for you
And now it’s your turn to go for me too

Your words are sparkling
Like the galaxy
It's not enough for me
If you're really mad about me
Show me something real
Prove to me you're true, oh, do

I've been to the moon don't tempt me
I've been where you are, God help me
I've been to the moon and stars for you
And now it’s your turn to go for me too

So help me, what's the golden rule?
Somebody better let me know
What's a girl to do?
Gone too far, can't hide my heart
Why don't you just show me what to do?
Oh, I love you, I want you
It's such a long way up to the moon
I've been to the moon and the stars for you
Now it's your turn, prove it

I've been to the moon don't tempt me
I've been where you are, God help me
I've been to the moon and stars for you
And now it’s your turn to go for me too

I've been to the moon so gently
I've been where you are, God help me
I've been to the moon and stars for you
Now it’s your turn to prove that you’re true
 
 
 
Ooh, you're searching for something I know won't make you happy
Ooh, you're thirsting for something I know won't make you happy
Ooh, you did it all again, you broke another skin
Its hard to believe this time, hard to believe
That my heart, my heart's an open door
You got all you came for, baby
So weary
Someone to love is bigger than your pride's worth
It's bigger than the pain you got for it hurts
And out runs all of the sadness
It's terrifying, life, through the darkness
And I'd do it all again, I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again, I'd do it all again
You try sometimes but it won't stop
You got my heart and my heads lost, ooh
I've been burning down these candles for love, for love
So weary
Someone to love is bigger than your pride
Ooh, someone to love, mm, someone to love
Someone to love
Ooh, you're searching for something I know, won't make you happy
Ooh
 
 
 
It's late and I'm feeling so tired
Having trouble sleeping
This constant compromise between thinking and breathing

Could it be I'm suffering because I'll never give in?
Won't say that I'm falling in love
(Please, please,) tell me I don't seem myself
Couldn't I blame something else? (No, don't say it)
Don't say I'm falling in love

Some kind of therapy is all I need
Please, believe me (Please, believe me)
Some instant remedy that can cure me completely

Could it be I'm suffering because I'll never give in?
Won't say that I'm falling in love
(Please, please,) tell me I don't seem myself
Couldn't I blame something else? (No, don't say it)
Don't say I'm falling in love

Ooo
'Cause I've been there before, and it's not enough
So nobody say it (so nobody say it)
Don't even say it (don't you even say it)
I've got my eyes shut, won't look
Oh no, I'm not in love

Could it be I'm suffering because I'll never give in?
Won't say that I'm falling in love (falling in love)
(Please, please,) tell me I don't seem myself
Couldn't I blame something else? (No, don't say it)
Just don't say I'm falling in love (don't say that I'm falling in love)
Could it be I'm suffering softly (don't say that I'm falling in love)
Caught on all what you've been giving me (don't say that I'm falling in love)
Falling in love (don't say that I'm falling in love)

Couldn't I blame something else?
(Don't say, don't say)
(Don't say, don't say)
(Don't say that I'm falling in love) Don't say
(Don't say that I'm falling in love)
(Don't say that I'm falling in love) Ooo, oh
(Don't say that I'm falling in love) Yeah
(Don't say that I'm falling in love) Oh
 
 
 
Do you ever think of me?
Do I ever cross your mind?
Does my memory linger
And flood the room for you?
Like when I’m alone and I’ve thought of you
Lazy Sunday afternoons
The radio will play a tune
And I can’t help but wonder
Just where you are
Although we’re miles apart
‘Cause you know that
Somewhere in this crowded world
Somewhere we can be alone
We’d set the world on fire
Time burns down like birthday candles
Don’t you want to go my love?
We can make it all alright
Why does it have to end?
If only you could read my mind
You’d see your name a thousand times
You paint me as an angel
But I’m just a woman
Who’s in love
Don’t play a waiting game
When it comes to us
'cause you know that
Somewhere in this crowded world
Somewhere we can be alone
We’d set the world on fire
Time burns down like birthday candles
Don’t you want to go my love?
We can make it all alright
Somewhere in this crowded world
Somewhere we can be alone
We’d set the world on fire
Time burns down like birthday candles
Don’t you want to go my love?
We can make it all alright
Do you ever think of me?
Do you ever think of me at all?
 
 
 
I was just waiting for your phone call
When they came along to say
That a rose done chased you clear away

You had said I was gamine
But we didn't mean the same thing I think
Broke my choux pastry heart
Guess life's, no picture post card

One for sorrow
Two for joy
Sometimes you win or sometimes you lose
I don't wanna lose you
Don't even own you
I just wanna stay right here
Until never dawns yeah

I was just waiting for your answer still
You made your own apologies
I cried so much I had to leave

Three for a girl
Four for a boy
Sometimes you win or sometimes you lose
I don't wanna lose you yeah
Don't even own you
I just wanna stay right here
Until never dawns yeah
 
 
 
I got taken in
We feasted on olives from the fridge
We stood the whole lonely day
We made love all afternoon
Til the stars went blue
You wrote a ballad
We dined on oysters and champagne
That's it seemed like
We connect in so many ways
So easy, I must say
Why am I so shy around you?
Why am I so shy?
Why do I take care to astound you?
Why do I even try?
Another rainy day
We sat inside by the radiator Watching old black and white films
Where everybody sang
You played in my solitude
Didn't get dressed 'til 2
The rain says all
I wrote this song on my guitar
But it didn't turn out right
So we just connected in other ways
So easy, I must say
Why am I so shy around you?
Why am I so shy?
Why do I take care to astound you?
Why do I even try?
Why am I so shy around...?
Why am I so shy?
Why do I take care...?
Why do I even try?
 
 
 
I know you’re probably expecting some poetic words
About love and the sun and the Universe
But I don’t need to explain
I don’t have to describe this
I hardly mention your name when I’m out with my friends
While they go over and over their dates again
They can see in my eyes
They can tell by my smile
Cause when I met you I was frozen
Nothing left my heart was broken
You came along
Just like the perfect song
My darling you
You make me do everything differently
Your love is taking me high as the moon
Don’t want to move
‘cause I don’t want to break the spell
Now that you’re mine
I’m staying quiet
‘cause my words are useless
They only confuse us
So why even try
When it’s so right
And I don’t want to break the spell
I know they probably want me to open the door
And tell it all to the world like I’ve done before
But it’s the things that you do
When there’s nobody watching
Shall we turn off our phones
Shall we close all the curtains
‘cause I don’t really feel like going out tonight?
Can't we hide from the world
All alone it’s so perfect
‘cause when I met you I was broken
Nothing left my heart was opened
You came along and brightened up my world
My darling you
You make me do everything differently
Your love is taking me high as the moon
Don’t want to move
‘cause I don’t want to break the spell
Now that you’re mine
I’m staying quiet
‘cause my words are useless
They only confuse us
So why even try
When it’s so right
And I don’t want to break the spell
Now I’m in a daze
Lost in time a space
And this can’t be replaced
I don’t want to break it
This is something new
A beautiful cocoon
That we’ve come into
My darling you
You make me do everything differently
Your love is taking me high as the moon
Don’t want to move
‘cause I don’t want to break the spell
Now that you’re mine
I’m staying quiet
‘cause my words are useless
They only confuse us
So why even try
When it’s so right
And I don’t want to break the spell
 
 
 
Here in the twilight of one endless summer
You’ve got me waiting like a teenage girl
My eyes wide with starlight
But folded in my new dress, the memories
Love is more hesitant a second time

Oh oh
Hey, I won’t break your heart like you broke mine

This time around I won’t cling to those paper crowns
I won’t tear you down
This time I’ll listen like it’s love’s first secret
So come bring your love here with all its mistakes
Speak to me softly like lovers do
Here are the fragments I saved for you

Oh oh
Hey, I won’t break your heart like you broke mine

Oh, it seems it’s easy to love you
You go to my head just like wine
All the bitterness, it has left me
So don’t leave me standing here
I won’t be satisfied
Unless you come here and stay by my side

Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
Oh it goes so fast
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
And it goes so fast
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
And it goes so fast
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
All that I know is that I love you
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
All that I know is that I want you
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
All that I know is that I need you
I won't break your heart
 
 
 
Oh, the night is full of miracles
And silvered with cold
High up on a hill the rest submit to sleep
And we are alone
Can't you see the path that I've chosen?
Won't you hold my hand until it's over
And love has created
There was a cool wind
There was a sharp sting
But you held your courage
What did the stars sing
The night that I looked at you
The night that I looked at you?
It was more than my heart could do
The night when I looked at
I folded you in a prayer with words so fine
How could you refuse?
My tears, they fell like diamonds in the light
The wind was so cruel
But I can see the kindness that burns in you
I regard the way that you hold me as wonderful, magical
There was a cool wind
There was a sharp sting
But you held your courage
What did the stars sing
The night when I looked at you
The night when I looked at you?
It was more than my heart could do
The night when I looked at
 
 
 
Tender is the light that shines on you
Gentle is the morning made anew
Delicate, the grace we’ve come into
My love
Wonder why you wish your life away
Waiting for the perfect boat to take
Waiting for the perfect wind to sail away

Life’s shining around you
Don’t miss a day
If you’re caught up in the chase
You hold your happiness away from you

Stop where you are
Under fading stars
This is the world we’ve made
There is no better place, it’s true
Light a fire where you are

Underneath a blanket of the cold
Lying in the dark, your seed will grow
Miracles just like a winter rose will be
Give up all the things you can’t control
Still yourself and watch them come and go
Wherever you are, you’ll find you’re home at last

Everything glitters around you
Don’t miss a day
The moon on the lake
The smell in the air when it rains
The people you can share with
The feeling you get when you’re almost there

Stop where you are
Under fading stars
This is the world we’ve made
There is no better place, it’s true
Light a fire where you are

Can’t stop the wild wind roaring
You can stop my poor heart from calling out
Light a fire where you are

Stop where you are
Under fading stars
This is the world we’ve made
There is no better place, it’s true
Light a fire where you are
 
 
 
It isn’t love, but pain, that makes you brave
A secret wire you walk but still remain devoted
Quaking like we’re old lovers
Aching in the dark
Wondering, who could be the one to melt your heart
I’ve seen love, vast as oceans
Melt like blood
I see your silhouette across the night
It makes me sad ‘cause you’re so beautiful
Lover, don’t wait too long
After all this bitterness
It tastes like caramel
After all this bitterness
Delicious as caramel
And it’s like seeing the sun again
After years of only pouring rain on my soul
It doesn’t matter now
Just to know it’s possible
Is all I ever dreamed
You give me strength I don’t know why
Resurrect me from the pyre
And it’s the sweet death of your pain
After all this bitterness
Caramel
There’s nothing I could do to make it right
And nothing I could say to make the dark seem brighter
But here’s the one that paints wishes
Riding on a star
Here’s the one that can make a fire
From just a spark
Lure me out, in the desert
And call me home
It tastes like caramel
After all this bitterness
Delicious as caramel
And it’s like seeing the sun again
After years of only pouring rain on my soul
It doesn’t matter now
Just to know it’s possible
Is all I ever dreamed
You give me strength I don’t know why
Resurrect me from the pyre
And it’s the sweet death of your pain
After all this bitterness
Caramel
 
 
 
I never knew you were standing on the shore
It says everything
Explains everything
That from then on it couldn't be just like before
It says everything
Changes everything
So don't you stand there wishing your life would fade away
And don't you go round with anyone who makes you feel ashamed

Goodbye paradise
I hope there's something you could try
Goodbye
You're so changed that you'd give it all away
Goodbye
Goodbye

I saw your face in the faded light
Said everything
Explained everything
It haunts all your days and it comes to you at night
You did everything
Blame anything
But don't you cut those ribbons to take away the pain
And don't you go round with that same old crowd
They make you feel ashamed

Goodbye paradise
I hope there's something you could try
Goodbye
You're so changed that you'd give it all away
Goodbye
Goodbye paradise
The sea
The majestic sea
Breaks everything
Crushes everything
Cleans everything
Takes everything
From me
 
 
 
And the heart speaks in whispers
And the heart speaks in whispers

And so it's all over
So they've already run
And we all fall down
And the clouds, they blot out the sun
Very soon your world could be different
But you've got your mind set on silence, silence, silence

The skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The waves will part, the seas will rend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
It won't be long until it ends
Singing "whoa"

But the heart speaks in whispers, you've got to listen

And the crowd is so loud
It feels like they'll drown you out
And the waves crash down
And there's chaos all around
Don't let your mind rest on violence, violence, violence

Oh, the skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The waves will part, the seas will rend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
It won't be long until it ends
Singing "whoa"

Cause the heart speaks in whispers
And the heart speaks in whispers
And the heart speaks in whispers
And the heart speaks in whispers
You've got to listen

Oh, the skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The waves will part, the seas will rend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
It won't be long until it ends
Singing "whoa"

Bright lights
Bright lights
Streaming, we're golden!
Sunlight, sunlight
Revealing, we're golden!
And you will know
And you will know it
And you will know
And you will know it
And you will know
 
 
 
How does it feel being in these arms?
What's it really like to be loved?
I've been alone now, how long?
Have you ever loved the way that I have?
And I have often wondered who
Who could love you the way i do?

Now I just want you to know
How I'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you
And I need you more each day
Baby, if you're still awake
Call me when you get this

I've got all this poetry now I didn't know then I kept inside
Guess I had never seen anything beautiful
Till I first saw you asleep at night
And I have often wondered who
Who could love you the way I do?

Now I just want you to know
How I'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you
And I need you more each day
Baby, if you're still awake
Call me when you get this

I just wanted to know what it was like, what's it really like to be loved?
These little volcanoes came as a surprise to me
I never thought I could be this way
And I have been cautious and I've tried to keep to myself, but who could love you the way I do?

Now I just want you to know
How I'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you
So much more each day
Baby, if you're still awake
Call me when you get this
Now i just want you to know, how i'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you
(And I need you) need you more each day
If you're still awake
Call me when you get this
 
 
 
I wait for you
I don't know why
All I know is I can't hide
At this temperature you could take over my mind
Like gossamer you softly touch
He draws me in
I'm powerless
He possesses an enchantment
Tell me
I'm forgiven
He calls, don't know how I fell under his spell
Lately I've been driven
He smiles an enchantment
I wait for you
I'm mesmerized
This love is like a potion in disguise
I tightrope walk with a blindfold on my eyes
I can't escape
Or so it seems
I'd run away
He's in my dreams
He possesses an enchantment
Tell me I'm forgiven
He calls, don't know how I fell under his spell
Lately I've been driven
He smiles an enchantment
It's the kind of sleepwalk that never ends
A type of loan with no dividends
It's a parlor game where you're given chase
Guess it could be called an acquired taste
I know he knows
He calls, I go
I know
This could be an enchantment
Why don't you tell me
I'm forgiven
He calls, don't know how I fell in love his spell
I'm forgiven
Lately
I've been driven
He smiles and I give in
An enchantment
 
 
 
Seems like everyone else has a love just for them
I don't mind; we have such a good time, my best friend
But sometimes, well I wish we could be more than friends
Tell me, do you know?
Tell me, do you know?
Oh
I get so breathless when you call me name
I've often wondered, do you feel the same?
There's a chemistry, energy, a synchronicity when we're all alone
So don't tell me you can't see what I'm thinking of
I can understand that you don't want to cross the line
And you know I can't promise you things will turn out fine
But I have to be honest: I want you to be mine
Tell me, do you know?
Tell me, do you know?
Oh
I get so breathless when you call me name
I've often wondered, do you feel the same?
There's a chemistry, energy, a synchronicity when we're all alone
So don't tell me (don't you tell me) you can't see
Oh!
'Cause I've tried to do this right in your own time
I've been telling with my eyes my heart's on fire; why don't you realize?
Tell me, do you know?
Tell me, do you know?
I get so breathless (I get so breathless when you call my name)
I've often wondered, do you feel the same?
There's a chemistry, energy, a synchronicity when we're alone
So don't tell me (don't you tell me) you can't see what I'm thinking of
I get so breathless when you call me name
I've often wondered, do you feel the same?
There's a chemistry, energy, a synchronicity when we're all alone
So don't tell me (don't you tell me) you can't see what I'm thinking of
 
 
 
He's a real live wire
He's the best of his kind
Wait till you see those eyes
He dresses like this different scene
He'll kiss you, make you feel sixteen
What's it even mean?
Are you here, are you here?
Are you here cause my heart
Recalls that it all seems the same
It all feels the same, pick me up
It's hard to recall the taste of summer
When everywhere around, the chill of winter
It gets so far away
Are you here, are you here?
Are you here cause my heart
Recalls that it all feels the same
And he comes to lay me down
In a garden of tuberose's
When he comes around
There's nothing more to imagine
Just tuberose's, tuberose's
Are you here? Are you here?
Are you here cause my heart
Recalls that it all seems like
All looks like, it all feels like
It tasted like, tasted, tasted like
When he comes to lay me down
In a garden of tuberose's
When he comes around
There's nothing more to imagine
Just tuberose's, tuberose's
Wait till you see those eyes
 
 
 
I'm feelin'....
I wanna love you
I want to love and treat you right;
I wanna love you every day and every night:
We'll be together
With a roof over our heads;
To share the shelter in a single bed;
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'? Wo-o-o-oah!
I wanna know - wanna know - wanna know now!
I wanna know - wanna know - wanna know now!
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I - I'm willing and able
(I'm willing)
So I lay my cards on your table!
I wanna love you -
I wanna love, love and treat - love and treat you right;
I wanna love you every day and every night:
We'll be together, with a roof over our heads;
We'll share the shelter, of my single bed;
We'll share the same room, yeah! - for Jah provide the bread
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'? Wo-o-o-oh!
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Tell me, if its love, love, love that I'm feelin'?
(Tell me)
I wanna love you - I wanna love, love and treat - love and treat you right;
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Someone tell me if its love, love ... 
 
 
 
Breakfast at Mickey's, make-up still on
Elbows on the greasy table cloth
One more coffee and one last cigarette
Smiling at the rain cause you hold me close
My best dress on underneath this old coat
Walking down Bleecker no one is awake yet
And onward, seven hours
Nothing but clouds
It's enough to make your heart sigh
I thought we should try
Pick me up and take me out
Oo we crash into love-filled nights
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Oo we race till we're out of time
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
And now that you've taken me up so high
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
I could see the lights from the restaurant
I couldn't quite perfect that nonchalance
Paris and champagne with one brown sugar cube
And we danced while the band played "She's not there"
Kissed me in the rain by the Rue Voltaire
It's a perfectly good way to ruin those silk shoes
Still, seven hours
Nothing but clouds
It's enough to make your heart sigh
We should try
For each other and for the lovers
Oo we crash into love-filled nights
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Oo we race till we're out of time
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
And now that you've taken me up so high
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
You change and you grow
But we were young
We were young and we didn't know
We didn't know
Oo we crash into love-filled nights
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Oo we race till we're out of time
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
And now that you've taken me up so high
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
 
 
 
Oh oh oh...
Maybe you've been pouring everything into this your mistake of
This attends to agony, you can't predict this when it comes to it
You can't hide from me, but don't you surrender anything..
Don't you know that, that patience is a virtue (yes it is)
And life is a waiting game...don't you know that, peace must be nurtured
And all the money in the world can buy you nothing... (i tell you that)
All these things happen, all these things happen for a reason
Don't you go on and throw it all away ...when the seasons change (you gonna change)...
Oh oh...
Hurts me to see you feel this way but it won't be always
Don't you know everything got to change
Oh... feels like all your hope is gone
You can't carry on, but there's nothing oh
You don't have to pretend with me, don't you know that
That patience is a virtue, (yes it is), and life is a waiting game
Don't you know that, peace must be nurtured...
All the money in the world can buy you nothing, (let me tell you that)...
All these things happen, all these I've done for a reason...
Don't you go on throw it all away , when the seasons change
Oh oh oh...
When the seasons change
 
 
 
I wear my horse print dress
And though my hair’s still wet
You kiss me on my neck
I haven’t told anybody yet
We spend our days and night
Lying by firelight
And your pretty eyes, looking at me so bright
Like I’m your one delight
You’ve got me spinning, spinning out
Don’t think that I can let go now

Baby
I’m tickled with your love
I’m flying
Spin this kaleidoscope round
’cause I don’t want to come down

I wear my lipstick pressed
Maraschino cherry red
And we wear our hair a mess
‘Cause we just got out of bed
This isn’t my first romance
But it hit me like an avalanche
I tried to talk about it on the phone
But you’re so different from the ones I’ve known
Ooh, you’ve got me spinning
I don’t think I can let go now

Baby
I’m tickled with your love
I’m flying
Spin this kaleidoscope round
’Cause I don’t want to come down
How can I just let you go?
When I don’t want to come down
Spin this kaleidoscope round

What you give
What you get
What you give
What you get
What you give
What you get
What you give
Oh, I can't let you go

And baby, I’m tickled with your love
I'm flying
I don't want to come down
Don't think I'll ever come down
Ahh, ahh
I'm flying
I don't want to come down
Don't never let me come down
 
 
 
Everybody sees it
I know they can feel it
Our subtle disagreements
The gesture that you’re leaving
I know you’re on your way
I see how you watch those planes
In the dark
In the dark
We stare into the silence
We focus on the distance
I watch the sky fall in
Anything could happen
But when the lights go out
Are we just strangers
In the dark?
We’re in the dark
Kiss me
Hold me to your body
If you’ll miss me
Don’t say a word
‘cause I’ll fall apart
Fall apart
Touch me, fold me in your arms
If you love me
Only for a minute
I’ll fall apart
Fall apart
Effortless at high school
Now everything is different
We were just children
Playing at lovers
When did it get so hard?
Remember those promises we made
In the dark
In the dark
Kiss me
Hold me to your body
If you’ll miss me
Don’t say a word
‘cause I’ll fall apart
Fall apart
Touch me, fold me in your arms
If you love me
Only for a minute
I’ll fall apart
Fall apart
What joy!
What pain!
I lost my way
And it happened in the dark
Kiss me
Hold me to your body
If you’ll miss me
Don’t say a word
‘cause I’ll fall apart
Fall apart
 
 
 
Sometimes when I close my eyes
I see your face and I see mine
Warm as the sun
I don’t know if I’m waking or sleeping
I don’t know if I’m thinking or dreaming
I just follow the sun
Sometimes when I’m in the dark
The thought of you is a tiny spark
Keeps me walking in the dark
Push on for the dawn
The night is silent
But dawn comes blazing in
It blooms like a flower
It burns to the heart of me
And everyday is our adventure
Keep pushing on
For everyday I want to thank you
You’re pushing me on
'cause you bring me joy
Everyday is a new beginning
Everyday is a chance to start again
Till time descends like a curtain, calling: “It’s the end”
Sometimes when the pain is gone
We move really slow just to carry on
You can go ahead if you want to
But I’ll be a river
My head in the mountains
My feet on the shore
Midnight when the lake is black
The moon and stars are reflected back
Into the night sky
So is my life, Lord
Reflected back to you
The life that was never mine
A move on the water
A whisper into the night
Everyday is our adventure
Keep pushing on
For everyday I want to thank you
You’re pushing me on
'cause you bring me joy
Everyday is a new beginning
Everyday is a chance to start again
Till time descends like a curtain calling: “It’s the end”
When love unveils its heart and shows you it is friend
When all I want to do is be dancing again
Keep pushing on
 
 
 
Working from seven to eleven
Almost every night
Really makes life a drag
I don't think, I try
Really been, the best of fools
Did what I could
Cause I love you baby, how I love you darling, how I love you baby, how I love you darling, oh
Since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Oohh ohh
All my friends have been telling me
That your no good
No no no
I've been trying to do the very best that I could

Seven to eleven almost every night
Oohh and I've tried, oh oh oh I've tried
Since I've been loving you boy
I'm about to loose my worried mind
Ohh ohh ohhh
Said, I've been crying
All my tears they've felt like rain
Oh, they've felt like rain
Oh, they've felt
Since, god, oh lord 
Oohh I've been trying to do the very best I could
I've been working working working working from seven to eleven, every night
And the drives, and drives
Oooh, oh and drives
Since I've been loving you boy, I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh oh oh
Oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh ohLet's smoke a little bit
And drink a little bit
Let's party all night
You better come on
Let's smoke a little bit
And drink a little bit
Let's party in the spirit
Of the Dogg, Nate Dogg

Smoke, Smoke
Pour out a little liquor
And have a gangsta party
Cause I miss my nigga
Six dudes sitting clean outside
No Auto-Tune, Nate Dogg in my ride
No Beegees, OGs in my ride
Hoodrats with tattoos screaming "eastside!"
Damn, cuz
I miss buddy love
Barbecue at King Park
In the memory of
The low low hitting switches
All my bitches
And three wheel motion
We west coasting
In the city by the sea
Call it 213
Nate D-O-double-G
On me


Uh, I'm all up in the party, just posted
Zoning out while the DJ playing west coast shit
Regulating the sound, it's getting explosive
The barber make it bounce, just like a six-four switch
And cracking women, they gon' come
And plus the homies here cause otherwise it ain't no fun
You feeling me? The year, man you know these songs
Here's another g-funk classic with the homie Wanz
You know we gone, hella folks blowing trees
Got a glass of 'yac (?) that this chick is pouring me
(?) and (?), shouts to Crytical and Warren G
Gotta say it one time, Nate Dogg, R.I.P
The game ain't been the same since he passed away
So I play his records all the time to bring him back today
Voice unforgettable, forever so incredible
Still, nobody does it better, no

You know it ain't a party until I step on the floor
Bottle in hand, plus I got a pocket full of that dro
We here to have a good time so you already know
If you got a chip on your shoulder, leave that shit at the door
You ain't gon' fuck up my night, cause I ain't having it, homie
Low tolerance for bullshit, you understanding me, homie?
Look here, roll up a smoke man, and pour you a drink
So you can get off in the spirit, dawg, and party with Nate
I feel honored to pay respect to a legend
And, uh, I believe all dogs go to heaven
A west coast pioneer and truly one of the best
Had a style of his own and stood out from the rest
If you from the west, throw your w's high
Grab a drink, two-step, and move from side to side
And I think it's about time we sparked one up in this bitch
So we can smoke a little bit while we drink a little bit
(x2)I'm just what you made God — not many I trust
I'ma go my own way God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, "Ain't no music on", she said, "No, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?

I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

Let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all, in the shop and I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don’t think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain’t working fam
I- In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
But, I can’t fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We’re all troubled, in a world in trouble
It’s scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I’m what you made God, fuck yes I’m so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane’s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?

I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

Need it to get by, ya
Willy
 
 
 
Mmmm, ay-oh
Hey...
Ratatat, yeah!
Na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-nah

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about the night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky?
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness
I know everything that shine ain't always gold
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good


I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

Pursuit of happiness, yeah
I gon' get it, I'll be good
Oh...
Oh man, oh, ugh...
Room's spinning, room's spinning...
Pat, Zuli...
Oh fuck
Oh my God, why'd I drink so much and smoke so much? Oh
Oh, fuck
 
 
 
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh

Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feelin' blue
The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night, night
At, at, at night, night

Na-na-na-na-na-na, Kid Cudi
Cleveland status, grind all day
Cleveland status, grind all night
Cleveland status, grind all day
Cleveland status, grind all night
 
 
 
I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
"Why he by himself?"
He got two older brothers, one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down: pussy and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

To my life, to my life, to my life...
Uh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
 
 
 
Plain Pat, what up?

My heart thump
Not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God
Made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone
Make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today
The last thing you remember won't be
About some apple bottom jeans
With the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real
Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

My mind runs
I could never catch it
Even if I got a head start
God please help me
I am feeling so alone, wait
I don't need to worry
'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga
Blessing in disguise, but
I am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bruh
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho
The shit is so ill
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

I'm ready for that
I'm ready for the funeral, hey-hey
I'm ready for the funeral, hey
I'm ready for the funeral
Hey, I'm ready for it
I'm ready for it
I'm ready for the funeral
 
 
 
Inhale and I want you to exhale
And I want you to follow your breath
10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott!
That's good. You alright?
 
 
 
She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me, hmm
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)

It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete (Yeah)
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

She said I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

Yeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me
I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me

I'm Yeezy, she say "Hi, I'm Aria"
No, you a angel, you wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, "No, not my Aria"
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria

I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you
 
 
 
Alright, run it
I never gave a fuck
I never gave a fuck about what niggas thought about me
I mean, I did, but like, fuck it, you know what I'm saying?
You gon' love me, man
You gon' love me, man

They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be okay to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like an airplane in the sky
But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like a bird sitting high, high

I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey
I be posted with my blunt and a brew, my dude
I'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon

It's like, I'mma play all my stuff for everybody
And you know, and all my people they give me feedback
You know, and they'll be like
 "Yo, yo, why your shit sound so different?"
You know what I'm saying?
"Why your shit, like on another level--
Why's, why's it sound so different?"
Like that's a bad thing
And I be like
"Why not, nigga?"

Close my eyes, high in the dark
It's a curtain call; come one, come all
All I do is try to make it simple
The ones that make it complicated
Never get congratulated
I'm something different, all aspects
Don't want a woman just to love her assets
I'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt, but that's the past tense

My mind is all hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
'Cause they used to call me lame, lame, lame, lame
My swag was a little different
But then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
But they the ones who lame, lame, lame, lame
I got the last laugh, nigga

I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey
I be posted with my blunt and a brew, my dude
I'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon
 
 
 
It's just me and my niggas
And my family
And people that care about me and my fans
Fuck all these other niggas

I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, they'll burn
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
They'll never take me alive
King Wizard

You love that, little bit of new, now throwback
Cleveland City snakeskin snapback
Niggas know the uniform, keep the brim low
You doubt him, don't know a damn thing 'bout him
What is hip-hop without him, y'all niggas just really don't know
Go, all day every day, hold on with all might
I gave the world my heart, and they gave the kids insight
Yup, now fuck you I ain't left
I'm outta my mind like all the time
And a nigga ain't missed one step, yet, yup

I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, they'll burn
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
They'll never take me alive
King Wizard

My head hurt, gotta give me something that'll make me feel good
I remember, couldn't tell a nigga nothing, man I wish you would
Niggas ain't working, like me I had to put my bid in
All this rose gold I'm dipped in
Juste un clou, while I coast through clouds
That's my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade
I'm going, going, I'm on a crusade
To save the kids from the weak shit
It's finally gonna be my world
Here all the girls can be my girls
Just sit back count stacks, girl
Hold a nigga down all the time, girl
Whaddup?

I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, they'll burn
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
They'll never take me alive
King Wizard

I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, they'll burn
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn

Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light

Born from dusk to dawn, I am truly alive
The satellite that sits in frame to illuminate this shaded place
He's a rose that don't belong, the music, the magic, take the lead
Come on with it, mmm, come on

Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design
Go with it, mmmm
Come on, don't fuck up the feng shui
Feng shui, feng shui, feng shui, feng shui

I see everything with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving
Stuck inside a statue, look at you
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you
A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful

Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light

The universe never steered me wrong
The universe never lied
Take me bound to the come me down
The fantasy in this remedy
Free from where you don't belong in the concept of time
New levels, mmm, come on

Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design
Go with it, mmmm
Come on, don't fuck up the feng shui

So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui

I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving
Stuck inside a statue, look at you
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you
A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful

Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light

Feel I'm being tested every minute
Feel like yesterday I was blind, I've been lost
Seems like I've stumbled on a path, no coincidence
Truly in my essence, I've arrived
Who am I? Who am I? Don't remind me
Too alive, too alive, new arriving
You were right, I was left in it before
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne
Parallel to paradise
I reach out for my lifeline
The angels laugh in paradise
They say I am my own lifeline, look in you
To the night, to the night I'm abandoned
To deny, to deny, what a sandpit
Couldn't I, couldn't I have an angel?
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne

So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui

I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving
Stuck inside a statue, look at you
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you
A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful

Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
 
 
 
Mmm, easy, back up, back up, back up, back up, uh
Turn your radio, turn your radio off
Watch me now, baby (Baby)
Uh-uh, uh-uh

Bitches in my ear, they sayin' they love me
Uh, you don't love Scott, you love the Kid Cudi
I ain't no fuckin' slouch, show you what I'm 'bout
My energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings
Transitionin' to my inner, I'm hearin' their voice
Tellin' me stay in focus, keep focusin', boy
Feelin' like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go, in any city
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore
Mixin' fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty, settin' off my groupie radar
Sippin' Hen', dappin' hands off the roof of my Porsche
A fresh nigga at large, a fresh nigga go hard
All my youngins say, "Keep it goin'"
All my youngins, they dumb and reppin', they always knowin'

Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute
Sexy mama, send her way, you doin' it, honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here (Be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

Life ain't easy sober, we live so geeky (Yeah)
Did just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama (Yeah)
Phoned home to the moon, did you change your number?
If and when you get this message, need you back home
Big bro, big bro, big bro (Yeah), big bro, back home
Big bro, we need you, come home, back home
Big bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home (Mmm)

High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher (Ayy, ayy)

Nightmares kept a nigga from closin' his lids (Lids)
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant, the hauntings ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are comin' for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxin', I'm whippin'
Last week, I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefin' good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah, nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie's so rock and roll
My princess Vada know rock and roll, Daddy got the glow

Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute (Yeah)
Sexy mama, send her way, you doin' it, honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here (Be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

Life ain't easy sober, we live so geeky (Yeah)
Did just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama
Phoned home to the moon, did you change your number?
If and when you get this message, need you back home
Big bro, big bro, big bro (Yeah), big bro, back home
Big bro, we need you, come home, back home
Big bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home (Mmm)

High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
 
 
 
I am the smartest man alive!

I tried to tell all my friends when I was a kid that I had powers
And nobody wanted to believe me
All right

Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
Hmmm, I got my lion heart
 
and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said, "Tonight I feel immortal," ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, whoh

Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

Bet you want to see me weak, not sort of my thing you see
I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost day and night,
 
young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely I'ma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, yeah

Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm


I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, yeah-ah
Ohh, I, ohh

Don't Fuck with me. Fuck with me. Don't, don't fuck with me. Fuck with me
 
 
 
God, I thought I loved you so
God, I thought I loved you so

They done let in the skinny jean-wearing
Fro-for-days in a old AA
Balling so low, most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt with a blunt full of P.E.
And I guess you know me
Been in NY so long, got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn—shout-out to the Madis
My bloodline runs deep
Nights, I don’t sleep
Figure it’s my pops keeping me awake
Help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
These motherfuckers can’t fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo-brain, ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks
Want to know what I think

Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucking lifestyle, 'cause, nigga
We, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucking lifestyle, 'cause, nigga, hey

I live through words, not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk, often the fave
'Til I came like 'Pac art and said true things
A whole new legion of some niggas
Aiming high, past the idea of slanging
Praise Allah for keeping me away, man
A lot of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Somethings will never be the same
Wish that I could tell my brother
Something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He’s leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn, you must understand
What I speak about in song, this how I really am
Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes, I really blink
Yes, I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day
Before I became the age to even rage
I was drowning my sorrows with some O.E., nigga

Hey, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucking lifestyle, 'cause, nigga
We, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucking lifestyle, 'cause, nigga, yeah
Oh, oh (Oh, oh-oh, oh)

Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about your lifestyle, 'cause nigga
We live this shit, hey
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about your lifestyle, nigga
Yeah, here we go
On, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
And we dream
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and...
 
 
 
Yeah, I see you hatin' over there
See you jockin' over there, see you lookin' at my girl over here
Why you worried 'bout the girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
Come on, hey, I see you hatin' over there
I see you jockin' over there, think about your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young hippy?
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yo

I don't love who I am so I'm workin' on a fix
I don't need a bitch tryna tear my mind on my grip
If I had one wish, it'd be to have more wishes, duh
Fuck tryna make it rhyme
Throw them stones, with your bitch ass
Cutting me deep and even though I bleed
I stand alone, alone I'll be
Heart of a lion still shinin' in this sucka ass
Workin', workin', workin', for inner peace
Fightin' for the freedom of my soul, I can hear the speech
Yeah I mumble while I'm trippin on so many pills
Hah, they figured that they know a nigga

Yeah, I see you hatin' over there
See you jockin' over there, see you lookin' at my girl over here
Why you worried 'bout the girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
Come on, hey, I see you hatin' over there
I see you jockin' over there, think about your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young hippy?
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yo
 
 
 
Two, three, four
Ohhh-oh-ohh

Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of the Chosen
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of The Chosen

Hmm, hey
Hmm, hmm, na-na-na-na-na-nah
The story of The Chosen,
 
Rose Golden
Mmm, mmm

Looking where we're at
How did we make it through this level all in one piece?
Hmm, oh, oh
Oh, where them friends now? I don't see 'em
And if I do, I don't sense the truth in 'em
Distancing myself while I'm focusing, fo-focusing
Don't pretend to worry bout shit
Go through one ear and out the other
Better off saying nothing, nigga
As I shine on and dream on, our vibes are on
Had one trip of a dream back in 2003
Who am I? And who will I be? Will I be free?
I need a sign, oh I need a sign

Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of The Chosen

Hmm, hey
Hmm, hey, na-na-na-na-na-na
The story of The Chosen,
 
Rose Golden
Mmm, mmm

Look at who you are, how could it be?
All I ever wanted was to find some inner peace
Mmm, oh, oh, oh
Where them haters now? I don't hear 'em
 to think they fucking with me, though
I put that on my soul, can't love, they jealous, so jealous, and some
Learning day to day, humans
Spread love to all my sisters and brothers, let's do better
Stop judging a nigga because they're different
We're supposed to groove to our own tune
So woke from that one tripped out dream back in 2003

And who do I see, baby?
The stars will align, the stars will align

Oh, since I was young, been groovin' to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of The Chosen

Hmm, na-na-na-na-na-nah
The story of The Chosen
 
 
 
Yeah, woah-woah, oh
Yeah, woah-woah, haha
Yeah
My name is Scott Mescudi, yeah
Yeah

Gotta get it through my thick head
I was so close to being dead, yeah
Life, live it, with nobody's help tips
Man, I'm just walking without being led
See the world is so crazy and filled with such risk and man
I just know I gotta dodge them, yeah
The beginning is always followed by an end
In the in-between time I'm not runnin' or hidin'

See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things trouble me

The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm most confused about the world I live in
You think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost?
Yeah

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, woah-woah, haha, yay
Yeah, whoa, whoa-whoa, yoo

Tried to fight it, but soon that gave in
Went down a road with no lights on
Can't describe it, and you don't move like them
You become their worst nightmare
You remember the things that your parents had said and well
Rather find out the hard way
You should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
I keep with my stroll, I'm not runnin' or hidin'

See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things still trouble me

The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm most confused about the world I live in
You think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost?
Yeah

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, woah-woah
Yeah, woah-woah

Oh-oh-oh
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
I really understand that they...
I really think I, umm...
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
Whow
Listen to me
Whow-whow-whow
Listen to me
Whow-whow-whow
 
 
 
I am happy to be alive
'Cause I know I could not be in a place that's filled with lies
Can't stand no quiet nights, while I fill up my glass with pride
Hopeful is all I know, how to keep me from silent cries
Nothing I can say, facing all this pain in my way
I fight it every day
Why am I this way?
A nigga tryna maintain
I sit and tell myself, "Okay"
We gotta find another way
You gotta find another way
You gotta find another way

Don't be so down, c'mon young homie
You'll be okay, you'll find real love
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely
Now is the time to show what you're made of

You'll be okay, you'll find real love
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely

Nothing I can say, done running from this pain in my way
I'm fighting every day
Why am I this way?
A nigga tryna maintain
I sit and tell myself, "Okay"
We gotta find another way
You gotta find another way

If my niggas don't fuck wit' you, I don't fuck wit' you
That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches, they my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur chick, call it my trill nigga
I met Duke in '92 and we still niggas
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas gon' eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet

Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be

Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right

Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they never change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin' got them sucka niggas hatin'
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' 'bout crack or we talkin' about blacks?
Spliffing the blunt up, then they pickin' the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin', they fittin' to run up
Then they gettin' the come up, yup, bitch
And they do it 'til the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas

Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be

Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right

I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know to please hit me
No question no hesitation when it comes to holding fam down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If it's a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad, my nigga

Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
 
 
 

I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

Through the day, ayy

I mean, you staring like a creeper 'cause you gotta peep her
I mean, you prolly might be saying you ain't jockin' either
But, man, ol' girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, the type to make you tell a bitch, "Just dance"
And fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for her bitches (Ayy)
Fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for the sticking (Ayy)
And fuck them other niggas, hope she down for some licking (Ayy)
And fuck them other bitches 'cause she down for the tricking, ugh
I'm hopin' she a rider
When it's said and done, do she spit it up or swallow now?
I ain't gotta trip about them niggas who like her
'Cause me and mami know who can really make her go

Oh, oh-oh-oh
 (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face
 (Ugh-ugh)
Pa-pa-poke her face

Oh, oh-oh-oh

AH-AH-AH-OH-OH
When I...

Pa-pa-poke her face
What she talking 'bout, 'Ye?
 Yeah

She said she want whatever she like
She said she gon' bring her friend
And we gon' have a hell of a night
Through the day

I made her say—Hold up, (Yeah?) born in '88? (Word?)
How old is that? (Man!) Old enough
I got seniority with the sororities
So, that explain why I love college
Getting brain in the library 'cause I love knowledge
When you use your medulla oblongata
And give me scoliosis until I'm comatos-es
And do while I'm sleep, yeah a little osmosis
And that's my commandment you ain't gotta ask Moses
More champagne, more toasts-es
More damn planes, more coasts-es
And fuck a bus, the Benz is parked like Rosa, -oza

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh
 (Yeah)
AH-AH-AH-OH-OH
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
I make her say

She said she want whatever she like
But you gotta bring your friend
And we can have one hell of a night
Through the day

She blamed it on the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-alcohol 
She had her hair did; it was bound to fall 
Down, down for a—damn, Cudi already said it
Her poker Facebook, I already reddit
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body, known to blow fuses
A stripper from the South, looking for a payday
Said, "Bitch, you should do it for the love like Ray J"
But they say, you be on that conscious tip
Get your head right, and get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the godly to the party
It's the way I was raised on the Southside safari, so

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh, AH-AH-AH-OH-OH
When I
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody
Can't read my, can't read my 
No, he can't read my poker face 
She's got me like nobody
 
 
 
Help me take off my Balmain jeans, I’ll undo yours
You can lick it after I’m done licking you first
I wanna taste it, tired of waiting, are you tasty?
Yahm yahm, come on baby, yahm
Hope you can feel that vibe, the vibes of the night
Your body is warm in my arms, we're under the stars
Can I come inside your vortex?
Can I come inside your vortex, let me baby

It’s been so long, been such a hobby
Finding someone who electrifies my body
I need you to protect my heart
Gimme your hand, put it here
This is where you start
Keep feelin’ on me, don't stop

Lord help me, lord help me
I got a lover under my covers, I don’t want her to leave
She says I'm perfect, perfectly kissing on my neck
She is the sexiest, she said she loves my scent
Hope you can feel that vibe, the vibes in the night
Her body is warm in my arms, we're under the stars
I wanna taste it, tired of waiting, are you tasty?
Yahm yahm, come on baby, yahm

It’s been so long, been such a hobby
Finding someone who electrifies my body
I need you to protect my heart
Gimme your hand, put it here
This is where you start
Keep feelin’ on me, don't stop

Zoom with me baby, yeah
Zoom with me baby, yeah yeah
Oh girl you’re so sweet to me
I love it when you’re zoomin'
Oh girl you’re so sweet to me
I love it when we're zoomin'
Oh girl you’re so sweet to me
I love it when you’re zoomin'
Oh girl you’re so sweet to me
I love it when we're zoomin'

It’s been so long, been such a hobby
Finding someone who electrifies my body
I need you to protect my heart
Gimme your hand, put it here
This is where you start
Keep feelin’ on me, don't stop

Help me take off my Balmain jeans
Help me take off my Balmain jeans
(Thank you)
Yeah, oh, it’s been so long
 
 
 
Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can’t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere

In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere

In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all


In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all
 
 
 
Duh-duh-duh, duh, duh, duh
As he falls back deeper, into a state
The return 


Nights my mind is speedin' by, I'm holdin' on
Askin' God to help 'em, are you hearin' me?
Girl is tellin' me she don't know what she want
Lotta demons creepin' up, they're livin' underneath
Gotta take a minute, y'all, traveled far
Feelin' somethin', no, I can't ignore my instincts
Back just where I started, it's the same old damaged song
It's the shit I need

Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Hm, talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't losе, I'm in the third act
Lord seein' me swervе
Do this to my loved ones, I've got some nerve
Don't think I'm not sorry

Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

Hm, I been here before
Hm, hm, I been here before, hm
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
As the story goes, hey, hey
As the story goes, hm
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

(Yeah) Standin' on the cliff right off Mulholland Drive
(Yeah) Back up on my late night session remedy
(Oh) Something 'bout the night that keep me safe and warm
Just me, the universe, and everything I think
Lotta shit is weighin' on me, it's a storm
Never thought I would be back here bleeding
I'm not just some sad dude
You can see my life, how I grew, I want serenity

Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't lose, I'm in the third act
See, it seems I'll never learn
I won't stop 'til I crash and burn
Tell my mom I'm sorry

Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

I been here before, hey, hey
I been here before, hm
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
And the story goes, hey, hey
As the story goes, hm
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me
 
 
 
I don't need, I don't need nobody

Please shut the front door and walk right in
In the land of the man who rock it hard for them
Super Solo Dolo attack, run and tell that
If you'd like to know, yes, I am on acid
Who could it be? K-I-D
Searching all day in the streets for DMT
Don't sip it, though - it couldn't answer
Drip, trip all day - bumpin' MGMT, homie
Watch on who you hate on, fam', without the facts
Sad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat
To me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that
You never seen a nigga like me?
I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth
Cause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about
But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill
But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip
Hoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'
I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber
Mmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker
Better get on back
You pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack
And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts
The world know what it be: Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo, C.U.D., repeat it

Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

I really want it - need it
Break bread - or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out "little Johnny is dead!" (oh you dead nigga)
You wish me well, I wish you Hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
If my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell it to meet me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn't

Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?
 
 
 
I'm single in the streets 'bout to get it in
Talking bout some drinking and some mingling (Woah)
Can't believe what I'm seeing, man, all these girls, look (Right), look (Right)
Hmm, they got me caught y'all, I just wanna make her feel hot
Let me smell your sin girl damn you look (Right) so (Right)

So many colors and sizes, so many surprises

(Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go)

Guess what
A nigga turnt up
All the windows closed for the roast up
Club club letting out finna post up
All I need is somebody to fly with and smoke this tree
Down for doing acid
Slim up on that waist, but that ass fit (Wow)
Let me feel your skin on mine unwind speak whats on your mind
And tell me somethin that moves me
Seen all types, different continents
Nothing more intriguing than an accent
That's a one, two, double up, get it up
So many surprises, so many colors and sizes
Love it (Mmh) they're so dope, they're so dope
We're all rolling, coasting

Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
(So many colors and sizes, so many surprises)
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

When you live like me you get used to fun
There's an endless supply of the beautiful ones
Open up those exotic thighs
The baddest little bitch half-Black, half-Thai
Don’t be prejudiced, cause she’s mixed
I'd still fuck the blackest bitch
That's how it is if you in my world
Light skin, white momma you a white girl
And I got that fever
And a big thick you know what I wanna feed her
Met a girl named Maria, its your turn, I love them señoritas
I like to fuck 'em, then I say fuck 'em
Lil momma can get a little something
OG Too Short don't stop
All the pretty girls call me Todd

I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
(Let me see that body!)
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

Yahm

Bitch!
 
 
 
Listen good, I don't have nobody
But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself continuously
Then I won't be afraid, no, no

Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

Look at me, you tell me just what you see
Am I someone whom you may love, or enemy?
Am I speaking for you and yours, or someone else?
I need some answers, yeah, yeah

Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

My world turns, flippin' the bird
To the ones who figure
Me outcast, no, not the duo
Back in Shaker Heights where they knew who
Do's little brother was a strange one, boo-hoo
Cry me a river, hater, look who
Traveled out an igloo
Cold-cold world wasn't fit for me at all
Look at where I stand at, tall
Clutchin' my Kid Cudi bizzalls
Mute motherfuckers back home, quick pause
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me, I bet I'm the one you think to fail
Floating in my mind, no sail
Ahoy, ahoy

Listen good, I don't need nobody
This is what you feel, are the sounds of insanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself to finish me
No, I won't be afraid, hey, hey

Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo

Why must it feel so right
When I know that it's wrong? It's wrong
When will I ever learn
From the words in my songs?
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo

Up in my crazy head
Stoned on the run-run, no fun if not
It's Scotty from the email read
Man, I swear to keep it one hundred
And if I ain't have it, then I'll be dead
My soul's been fed tonight
Everything that I choose, still can't forget Grey Goose
Converse covered with mixer juice
And all my niggas rolling up in the booth
Who got me on another one?
Someone please roll me another one
They tell me all good things must end
But those motherfuckers ain't have this friend

People talk shit' bout me
Deep down they knowin’ they ain’t right
When I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes
When I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes
People talk shit 'bout me, and they know that I know
And they also knowing they ain’t right
When I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes
Cause when I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes

Rejuvenated, recreated, rebooted, in a new program
Prada calf’s, black skinnies, T and hoody
Y’all niggas know the brand, GQ mustachin’ I’m in LA
Soaking up the sun and I’m laughing, what can I say?
I love the way the fans say they love me
I know it’s all because my God above me
But damn I’m feeling like Sam
Except my daddy ain’t stuck up no video game
Things changed, for the good
He watched my back until the world started knowin’ my name
This should be in the Bible
Middle finger up to the people who don’t like you
Who have no valid reason to say they never liked you
We don’t give a fuck fam
So what?! We never liked you niggas anyway
Pardon my wizard talk, but I’m elevated
No drank, no tree and I’m levitated
I got my own empire, I’m the baby
I ain’t taking care of nobody but my daughter and my mom
Places to go cause I need to build a travel log
I travel while you jake niggas run a blog
Now run along, I got some shit that needs posting
While I’m winnin’ livin’ life, skippin’ grinnin’ on em
All hail King Wizard in the fuckin’ house
Been chill for a minute quiet as a mouse
Now I got the juice, call me Bishop when you see me round
I be showin’ love, showin’ love baby, dap and pound

Yeah, Mmmmhmmmmm, yeah, mmmhmmmhm

People talk shit' bout me
Deep down they knowin’ they ain’t right

People talk shit 'bout me, and they know that I know
And they also knowing they ain’t right
When I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes
Cause when I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes

Truth comes to the light all the time
You can’t hide from fate, you can’t hide
Truth comes to the light all the time
You can’t hide from fate, you can’t hide
Truth comes to the light all the time
You can’t hide from fate, you can’t hide

Thought you were my brother, I thought you were
Thought you were my sister, I thought you were
Thought you were my homie, I thought you were
So absurd
Thought you were my brother, I thought you were
Thought you were my sister, I thought you were
Thought you were my homie, I thought you were
So absurd
I am a person with powers, I possess the power
You can’t hide, see me shine
 
 
 
Now when the sun come up
I'll be there to say "What up" in the morning
Brush my teeth
Find that clip I been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up in the bud
I float somehow in my bedroom
Turn around
See myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come
To the same place it began
My dreams and imagination
Perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher

I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

Uh, higher learnin'
I see the dreams I made
So I'm cooler now
I can take care of my mom and my little niece Zuri
So sing along, lil mama
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama, no
I provide for friends and fam and fans
And Cleveland City grinding, man
Stay afloat, the key is hope
I'll never let a motherfucker break me, dawg
Who gives a fuck? If a nigga don't like your steeze
Tell 'em to buzz off your N-U-T's
We don't care what people say
Dudes who critique your clothes are most gay
I ain't gotta wait for no one
If I wanna fly, I can fly for freedom, hey

I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

Wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake (Yeah)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake

Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake

'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

Whatever
So, whatever
Whatever
So, whatever

The end is never the end
A new challenge awaits
A test no man could be prepared for
A new hell he must conquer and destroy
A new level of growth he must confront himself
The machine and the ghost within
This is the journey, of the Man on the Moon
 
 
 
It's a revolution
Hmm, yeah, hmm, yeah
Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Aa-aaa-ay, a-aaa-ay

Da-le-lay, de-le-lay
Da-le-lay, de-le-layYeah, Outlawz!
E.D.I., Young Noble, Kastro
I am yours truly, Focus…
Let's go!

Now you done heard a lot of talk 'bout me and my niggas
Them outlaw worldwide mob figures
From triumph to tragedy
To right back on top and niggas still mad at me
For pushin' that big truck on 24's
A square feet in ATL game lockjaw
Man, that's what my nigga got shot for
Bein' to muh'fuckin' raw for these fuck boys
See the darkness, see the light, he wanna kill it
Misery love company and that's the real shit
But in 2005 I'm on some kill shit
'Fore a nigga sneak upon me and peel this
I'm takin' a stand with MAC in hand
Born killer like them niggas in Pakistan
It's simple, gotta get 'em 'fore I die
Like the old West, see now we load TEC's to ride

I know, Mama, you did your best at raisin' me
Now your baby done became a G
When I'm out in them streets
The only one that got me is me
I keep my hand upon my heat
'Cause you know, Mama, you didn't raise no bitch
So if a nigga wanna get at me
I be out in them streets, my thing cocked
'Cause really all I got in the end of the day is me
Real talk

Every day is a new challenge
I'm a savage in my New Balance
A lot of rappers but not enough raw talent
Blame the machine but fuck it, I'm a hustla, bitch!
So we start our own label sellin' bricks legit
Power to the people, a lot of power in my pencil
We the hope for the hopeless, a voice for the voiceless
Outlaw soldiers, we still in the game
Years later, less members, but the feelin' the same
Straight from the heart, we makin' a mark
Live for the day, don't wait for tomorrow
Haters gettin' they wrong
I seen the streets wrap sheets round the toughest of niggas
I seen prison put religion in the roughest of niggas
They say gangstas don't live that long, too many turncoat
That's fucked up, puttin' cuffs on your folks
Coincidental the Outlawz instrumental
And raisin' a thug nation, we influential

I know, Mama, you did your best at raisin' me
Now your baby done became a G
When I'm out in them streets
The only one that got me is me
I keep my hand upon my heat
'Cause you know, Mama, you didn't raise no bitch
So if a nigga wanna get at me
I be out in them streets, my thing cocked
'Cause really all I got in the end of the day is me
Real talk

My mother ain't made no sucka
Raised in the gutta, I'm a made motherfucka
All I know is get paid, motherfucka
All day, motherfucka, one way or another
And ain't nobody nowhere that can stop me
Call me cocky—you tennis, I'm hockey
Mix a little bit of Pac and Yaki
With black Rocky and my pops who got me
Real talk, I never took a short
Unless it was support, I'm stressin', ain't my fault
And I walk these dogs, I'm a soldier
Don't you wanna be like me when you grow up?
A man of honor, comma, good Karma
Niggas wants drama, I got the problem solver
Big-ass SIG, that's that shit
Plus a bully, that's a fully-automatic!

I know, Mama, you did your best at raisin' me
Now your baby done became a G
When I'm out in them streets
The only one that got me is me
I keep my hand upon my heat
'Cause you know, Mama, you didn't raise no bitch
So if a nigga wanna get at me
I be out in them streets, my thing cocked
'Cause really all I got in the end of the day is me
Real talk
 
 
 
You know what I mean? I don't wanna burn and I want to be for ever
That's what Outlaw Immortal is
I wanna be here for ever, when I'm gone, I want my name to be here
So to do that, I got to do more than that the average of a man would do
I gotta set a mark that nobody can touch
When I set that mark I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it happen

Outlaw motherfuckers till we die 

2Pac back, 2PacBack
There's all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better Picture Me Rollin'
Riding brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I'm stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming 2Pac back, 2Pac back
There's all these btiches screaming that 2Pac back

So many battlefield scars
While driven in plush cars
This life of an outlaw
Got me missing my doggs
Screaming (Rick Ross: 2Pac back)
Yeah this that outlaw crack
Real niggas respected. hommie where ever you at
Yeah, We been put in them Broklyn's
Makaveli we're breathing
Bald heads, Ta-Toos, and some brand new rims
Without no serial numbers
It's been like 15 summers
Since The Big Hommie died, but we still doing numbers
We trading war stories, Outlawz on the rise
Jelous niggas I despise
Look at my eyes
I told E.D and Hussein we gotta G-Mix this
Went at the 96, and ressurect Pac in this bitch
Fuck the peace, Makaveli The Don, and Biggie Smalls
Killer Kadaf, we're still on our job
Riding, blessed and buster free
Enemies give me reason to be The Last Motherfuckin' Breathin'


They yelling 2Pac back
But nah he ain't back
The Hommie never left
And that's a well known fact
Over 100 million sold
We're renown across the globe
Rap's Bob Marley
He'd legendary like Presley
Streets can't let him go
We'll I'm in that all black chevy with the windows closed
Blowing hella dough
Bumping Makaveli, Will they blast for me
I bought a couple of bottles pour 'em all out for the hommies (Background vocal: R.I.P)
Know the Kane for the pain, Tryna stop all these bleedin'
They say life is a jerk, so don't stop belivin'
On the wings of love, way above the clouds
That's the only way to fly
We blowing zone-z out loud
We yellin'


I let these niggas worry if 2Pac back
I got a block 20's in the bag who got smacked
You see Hussein standing here, it's the new Iraq
Shit man, The Midget dropped the album who caught that
I'm FatalVeli The Don, got these miss.'s in love
She confused with them snitching niggas but this is a dough, oh
Most niggas don't know what a grind is
Sally Pack on the wall of fake watch and armed beats niggas don't even know what time it is
I'm as real as they come, from the Slums from the Streets
When I'm 5 feets, the only way you bombs gonna hit
Scully over my head, to hoes right where they eyes that
We call it the money train and hommie we ride that
Or hand on my fitted overlocked in a study
See I don't goin', I don't know a bell pop with I'm ready for
And my enemies bitch, shoot a 2 cup straps
Within the camera after court
They holler, 2Pac back

Mutah

K-Dog
On the real gettin' high
Label us the young thugs
Niggas leave with much mail
Fuck hoes, fuck the law, and fuck jail
Young niggas never had a prayer to prevail
These killing fields can be hell

 complicated, we grew up crime related
From watchin' them old folks smoke dope, yo it left us faded
But on the killing fields, as real as some niggas chill
Realize and recognizin', you survive if you got bigger steel
Then it was only a minute 'til our time was coming
Yo it was at the point don't have no run ins with those fucking youngins
See all the grown ups was dead or smoked up
Left with no game to soak up, we said fuck it and loc'd up
Back to the street , and to make beats
But then there those who'd be rich if we didn't did it
Murder but ain't nobody feel us still now it's too late
We ain't nothing but bait for them killin' fields

Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is
Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is

I came through lookin' up to, who?
The high rollers, with the gold chains that's call as eye's swolers
But now as I look back and think about my wishes
Seeing them same killin' niggas turn to snitches
So I stay high and suspicious
For these steels can get real fuckin' vicious
I know you feel me
If you nigga how you can't
I'm gettin' hot and lick a shot when I'm amped
And I ain't got nothing on my mind but my riches
Bury me a g, ain't got time for no bitches (biatch)
Thinkin' they fuckin' with a nigga on heels
Baby I must keep it real, for my niggas on these killin' fields

Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is
Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is

Now I can get through this, ain't nothing to this
Matter of fact many if not plenty more, muthafuckas be alive
If they knew this, I keeps my shit wicked
Throw your hands in the muthafuckin' air as I kick it
Tryin' to see a meal ticket before I'm gone
Papa never got the chance to tell me it was on
But now I'm torn
Trapped between the devils curse and a hearse
Left with nothing but childhood pictures in my grandmama's purse
Now I strap up for the showdown
Grab my four pound and some more rounds
Bet these thugs would love to slug, so get low down
Words can't express how I feel for my steel
On these muthafuckin' killin' fields

Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is
Gotta keep my eyes on the steel
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is

Nigga you better duck when I run up
And throw your fuckin' gun up
Or be the next nigga to get tore up
Static is what they starting, money is what I'm hoggin'
Blacked as fuck, somebody better start talking
Best to believe I will bury ya, or be the next nigga
To be dead in your area, I'm scarier
Ain't nothing spooky about this shit here
Truth'll be the vivid living now you got to pay your bitch
Playa, I carry down strap with all my niggas
Best to believe, I'm yelling thug life when I pull the trigger
I throw your lights when I blast
I tear a hole in your ass, fucking hole in your ass

Gotta keep my eyes on the steal
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is
Gotta keep my eyes on the steal
Can't be the next victim of the killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So I'ma bust, and kick dust when it is

Young thugs throw they dub up, wanna be just like us

Real soldiers never fall, we keep pushin' along
And we prob'ly ain't involved unless it's paper involved
This official as it get, Snoop Dogg and them Outlawz
Born on the West, raised on the East
Best of both coastses, voice of the streets, let's go

Man up or man down, stand up or stand down (down)
You know the rules, what goes around, comes around (comes around)
What goes up, yeah it's comin' down (comin' down)
And if that bitch can't swim, then she bound to drown
Man up or man down, stand up or stand down (down)
You know the rules, what goes around, comes around (comes around)
What goes up, yeah it's comin' down (comin' down)
And if that bitch can't swim, then she bound to drown

Out of 25 niggas, 20 gon' try to kill ya (bang)
Then outta them five, two don't really feel ya (bang)
Then outta them three, one gon' get familiar (bang)
Then outta them two, they gon' set ya up to kill ya (that's karma, that's karma, bang)
What's done in the dark'll come to the light
You used to pull up, mob on them boys
The tables done turned 'cause you run in the night
Death to my enemies, slaughter opposers
One in your face, it's sort of a closure
Bang, bang (karma, karma), now nobody knows ya
Bang, these niggas ain't nothin' like us
They ain't gon' bust a grape in a fruit fight, so
Why these niggas actin' so tough?
I done played around, got fronted on
Hit the ground but now I'm back up
But there comes a time in the middle of the rhyme
When actor stop and you fucked, nigga (fucked nigga, nigga, nigga)
That's karma on ya muthafuckin' head, nigga (head, nigga)
I'm finna paint you red, and you dead, nigga
Actions speak louder than words, but ain't nobody talkin'
I come through with karma in the  and get to
Ba-ba-ba-ba-barkin' on these niggas

Work-work-workin' on these niggas
Talkin' on, stalkin' on, C-walkin' on these niggas
Lurkin' on these niggas
Breakin' bread, take ya meds
To sustain my mindframe
Dogg Pound, that's my gang
Daylight my time change
Taste like that Bombay

Look at the way that I shine, it's a sight to behold
A-1 from the jump, never snitched, never told
Stay up on my toes, peepin' game is a must
Livin' my life on the move, it's only a few I can trust
So rare, it's like I'm not even here
Until they see me in the flesh
Then they know that it's real
So clear, no clouds, like a VVS
No challenge, know Cali, but we still the best huh
Let 'em have it like a spree, no brown, all green
It's a small thing to a outlaw, Don King
We still gettin' to keep the movement like 18 Wheelers
Stay away from squealers and bullshitters
It's them niggas

Man up or man down, stand up or stand down (down)
You know the rules, what goes around, comes around (comes around)

September 13th 1996, On the Vegas strip he laid to rest
Ever since I had a hole in my chest
And it happened the one day you ain't rock your vest
Only 25 you ain't even reach your full potential
Going through your struggle with the whole world watching you
Sat by you in the hospital for 6 days straight
I'm thinking damn how much can one man take
My thug angel I won't stray you
You saved us and raised us
Homie this corner's like cages
Graced the world with your presence Ima rep it till the death of me
O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
, the recipe
I'm the voice of the slum, the hope for the young
I'm the last outlaw man I know I'm the truth
I was trained by the best to carry on tradition
To carry the torch complete the mission, streets is listening
They keep axing is Pac alive
I tell em hell yea nigga you can see him in my eyes
All you gotta do is look it's a page out the book
We starting a new chapter
This a cash bill massacre
It's more than music
Homie its a movement
Only Makaveli know what we doing because he approved it
It's all God's plan you ain't go nothing to do with
Young Niggas understand me, they know just why I do this

Homie this ain't love
I was sent to you niggas from Pac
Him and Khadafi was hot
They thought ya'll was gon' stop
This is God's plan, I am God's best friend
I feel like I'm in the same car Pac got shot in
But it's bulletproof
Fuck Talking you can see the truth
If your past is a hypocrite what the hell he teaching you
Take the Farrakhan route and try to reach the youth
My people dying before we get a chance to reproduce
The government keep lying, god bless the fucking troops
While the bullets flying Bush sipping Grey Goose
My little cousin doing life he only 22
Telling me he aite for something he didn't do
We here for a reason, do you niggas understand?
Ja, theres no man who can stop God's plan

Real Niggas be saying, if your boy was living
Rappers now a days, they wouldn't be getting
I've been in the game real heavy since before '9-5
Knew BIG when his timbs used to lean to the side
I'm a outlaw nigga, blood sweat and the tears
Some of the realist from the row, yeah you heard me clear
Yea they owe us some change because we done paid our dues
I'm still hungry as hell, these rap niggas is food
Looking for cash money so we heading to Cashville
That nigga Buck real fuck how you niggas feel
Heater tucked still close to my flesh
Kadafi on my mind, nothing but murder left
 
 
 
Chorus: Daz *singing*
What's ya fantasy, what's ya fantasy

You want your ass and your pussy chewed out
But baby that ain't what I'm about
Let me stick all this in your mouth
Now won't you get freaky, and won't you turn it out
And have visions of the dick and balls getting swallowed (like that)
Let you swim in, the sperm and no ?
Throw that pussy into a bottle
And let it float to shore, gimme gimme some more

Creamy sweetness while I'm dreamin, got me stuck
Between a night of romance and freaky fuckin to harmonic screamin
Picture perfect on the ceiling, that's only right
Caught you lookin at that action, behind the smile
Settle down, oh you wild child
Hit it, insane spot, like ? Glocks
Hit it, stop, hit it hit it, stop, hit it, ahh
That's when you switch to automatic like you really want it
Cause I been waitin to participate and engage in
Multiple comin phases, takin you to Storm-y stages
So what you say nigga, come and play with me
Have you fallin, on your knees, like I'm your savior
Now praise power to the pussies that be runnin the game
And if you can't swing that shit, then you grounded main
You need to understand, I need a Thug in my gameplan
A freaky ass nigga with a big thang
Chorus 1/2
 Tell em Noble!

Hey freaky bitch I love my nuts licked all night
Uh-huh, you know that ain't right
You want a young nigga like, me, to add on to the ?BLE?
Knock the tent from 11 to 3
We puff a L afterwards, afterwards no words
Spoken strokin til the pussy stayed open
Tiffany, claim she missin me, on a late night
Talkin to her friends, sayin dig it that pussy ain't right
Freaks they love to ride it like a mini-bike
On any given night, makin sure she lick it right
Up and down, side to side, all around
In and out, keep some extra bitches in the house
My Thug Passion keeps the Thug Luv everlastin
Double plastic for them double fat asses
What's ya fantasy?
 What's ya fantasy? What's ya fantasy? What's ya..
Chorus
 Said ooh, you got the bomb
 I got the bomb
 Bitch you got some bomb ass pussy

Ooh, you got the bomb

She said if you want this pussy you can have this pussy
If you really want this pussy you can have it -- say it again
If you want this pussy you can have this pussy
If you really want this pussy you can have it
It was a Coupe thing, Coupe thing
Got her thang tonight, it was a Coupe thing
I was in the mood to hurt somethin thick
Thick legs, thick thighs, and real thick hip
It was 2:13 I was in the mix
Singing 'Baby girl, you in the mood for this'
She said 'Hell yea, I'm in the mood for this'
So I whipped it out and let her have this dick, beyotch!

Follow me, and you'll watch me grow
Even though we all know I don't love them hoes
Know you're horny, we can gets to fuckin
All a young nigga want is ?

To me to be Young in the A-G-E where I gotta
Lot of problems that a bitch can't see and I gotta
Brand new key to the telly make it slippery
Like jelly through some shit, the devil wouldn't tell me
Bend over, find your ankles swallow my nuts while I spank those
That's what you get, pull your ears, ?
Non-stop, I break you out like a weapon
Now drop, get on your knees come and grab it beyotch!
Put this Hennesey bottle in your cock
Let your girl hit the top, I love to watch

 *singing*
Say girl.. what's ya fantasy

Gettin freaky in the night, show me ecstasy
You wanna bust a nut, what about me

Chorus

Let me tell you my fantasy
You want a nigga to beat that pussy up
You know you like that girl

All mine all mine all mine
*keep repeating 'all mine' to end*
Pussy, turn it out some good pussy
Good pussy
 
 
 
I'm kicking... I'm kicking. And you gonna help me

Get the fuck out of here

I'm serious. I mean...
We don't even get high off the shit any more
We just do it to keep from getting sick

These motherfuckers wanna know why.. why we get high?
That ain't a dumbest question I ever heard?
Check it.. listen..
Some people ask why (that's why nobody give a fuck, why?), why we get high... (high)
Doctor give me something for this pain, I need some Novakane (what you call it?)
Stimulate my brain (brain) escape to a higher plain (plain)
Hennessy, Ty weed, it's all the same, we call it Novakane (what you call it?)

Now we fall, it's my world, it's still spinning
Bent back wondering if GOD will let me in, in the end
All my life had been a constant fight
With the evil and these people ain't tryin' to see a nigga do right
Why is that? I can't shake this monkey on my back (back)
All that black clout, follow a nigga where im at
Now isn't that wild? (wiiiild) of course
I'll die and live my life high, deep inside im lost
And this show is showing, my people knowin' I'm dead
Walkie-talking to my homies wit' a bullet in my head (bullet in my head)
Still breathing, all my real G's leaving
Me, no choice, but to feed these demons
With murder and liquor in the mist drama niggas never heard of
Twist it, makin' it hard, even to listen to my mama, don't cry
When it's time for this nigga to die
Call it Novakane, ain't no more pain in the sky (get high)

Some people ask why (why?), why we get high (high)
Doctor give me something for this pain, I need some Novakane (Novakane)
Stimulate my brain (brain) escape to a higher plain
Hennessy, ty weed, it's all the same, we call it Novakane (what you call it?)

Watchin' time pass by my eye, that's why you always see me high
From this life that I was given it's like I'm livin' to die
Pass by my old hood it's all good, but it's dry
Tryin' to stray away from crime, these niggas ridin', but they blind
Nothin' in my hood, but dope, coke and herb smoke (got that coke, nigga, got that coke, nigga!)
Blowin' out all nerves, ghost, sittin' on the curb broke
Pockets lapped out, I thought you had it all mapped out (damn..)
Too far gone to back out South on a Novakane route
In and out the system prisons be wishing a nigga visit
I'm too young for this dumb shit, Novakane make me numb quick
Lord could ya, would ya help me, this crooked world won't accept me
But I proceed to get high, so just let me
Lost in the game (damn!) Novakane go to pain
The whole world looking strange
To me, get me high, Novakane

Some people ask why (why?) why we get high?
Doctor give me something for this pain, I need some Novakane (Novakane)
Stimulate my brain (brain) escape to a higher plain
Hennessy, ty weed, it's all the same (what we call it?) we call it Novakane

I lights up a Newport
Express my true thoughts
Put it down on paper
Got a dubsack, save it for later (got that blood, nigga)
And now I'm herb crumblin'
This words stumblin' up out my brain
Get a hold of that damn thang, to release the game
It destroys my brain, but I can't complain
'Cuz best believe, when I turn out the frame, I left feeling no pain
And on that note I came to the world high as dope
So how you think I'm gonna leave when Novakane holding me?
Tightly, that's how my blunts get rolled up
Quickly, hurry and light that shit before I go nuts, hold up
Before you take a sip of that liquor (aiyo nigga, pour some of that shit out, nigga)
You best to pour some more of that shit out for yo niggas (Makaveli)
'Cuz look, I breaks bread where homies livin' the dead (deal it)
We all need this shit, reminisce, squeeze the '5th
And Jesus, couldn't deliver me from the pain (pain)
'Cuz when I called him, he told me to get at Novakane (Novakane)

Some people ask why (why?) why we get high?
Doctor give me something for this pain, I need some Novakane (Novakane)
Stimulate my brain escape to a higher plain
Hennessy, ty weed, it's all the same, (what we call it?) we call it Novakane


Just to let y'all know, Why every young nigga on these streets nowadays is gettin' high
Some of us smoking weed, some of us drinking. I know some niggas, that doing pills

Four victims, now here's a stick-up
Thinkin' of how they did my nigga figures
Hard to imagine, god in action
Lords relaxin' hard when im askin' for every card
Now what about when you think
How the fuck you really get here
And how we get what how we get black and how we get that nappy head
Harrased and everywhere the fuck we go
I dont know, what about when you could picture ica make your mind blow, kaboom
My mic be soon times fight me like, get away get away
Long nights on airplane flights
I be imaginen if Pac and beg free, lockin' him down
Poppin' from seed to seed, so mother - fuck can happy
Tap me if this is just another dream
Once again I'm trapped and at the wencence
That I ain't go no reminiscence
Damn so many wishes, all is bein'
I can't take these bitches, so I stay suspicous
Makin' my melon imagine

So hard to imagine
Know thinks before they happen to you
What if you was already new, true
So hard to imagine
Where will I be this time next year
Here up there somewhere

I see these suckers on the creep
So now I gets to get on my feet
Runnin' late this player hatin' niggas
Cause these hoes disagree
But ain't just me that think this game should be sold
Is plenty so many but it won't be in it
If this fame anymore
Cure it's blow I thought I'm trapped
I won't be livin, cause the way that i act
But i react the kinda wacky sayn goin that shit
And everyday my nigga is saying
Dont trust no bitch
Im kinda simple steelin im a hole shit
Down I'm seein' stress by the pound
And every day im scream, c'mon help me now
Been wakin' up, plenty tears for years
Hard to imagine, nigga
 
 
 
 - repeated throughout track - x 23
Fuck With Me!

Baby-girl, you know you put it on me
Shakin your ass in the quarter for me
It's like de-ja-vu the way I met you
You told me you and your nephew
Blow Makaveli too, but smash that boo
Cause that's a bootleg
And it was hard to take my eyes off your legs
Listen can I buy you a drink?
Let your home girl hold your mink
The dead thought made for you and me
Can you walk with me, talk with me
Or one-night stand with me, probably
The answer I can hear tonight
Hips, dick-lick the lips, bitch you goin home tonight
I'm a money-maker, just shakin that thing your momma gave you
Creamin that black heritage, I can't wait to taste ya
You got one life to live, with much to give
Don't play yourself short, Miss Thang, give it here
And what's this I hear, about you top class
That down-south ass will make me spend some cash
Now did you listen to the words I was spittin at ya?
You so much you gonna make g-star rival at ya

I give it to you good girl, in the heat of the night
Even when I'm rollin, cream you right
And I ain't even tryin to sleep on old girl
Millennium dime-piece she movin her own world
N-O-B-L-E, brag on his dick
I ain't tryin to lock you down, hear the slap on the wrist
And I'm the type that talks flicks, when I'm up in it
She ain't the type to throw fits when I bust in it
So what's fuckin with that
She like to lay on her stomach so I bust on her back
And I don't care if she a groupie or not
I'm gettin head on the block and the hooptie'll drop
Root-Crew been hot since back in the day
And since I knew Pac, I'm havin my way
And now you wish you would have stuck with me
Cause all your honeys wanna fuck with me
Where they at? Where they at?

Because I'm headin somewhere
And them other (niggas baby) (rappers gone) gonna be dead in a year
Plus, I know you tired of them fake thugs
All-be gangstaz in they video with make-up
Uh, I don't think so nigga, I'm an outlaw nigga
Hear the heat blow nigga?
Uh, then have the time of your life
One night, next day you tell them people you're my wife
Cause can't nobody do it like this
A lot of mother fuckers talkin but we true to this shit

Come on, straight off the straights of hard time and no luck
Some wonderin niggas that ankled this game and came up
They ain't wanna fuck with us power to this
But we said 'fuck that' and set fire to this bitch nigga
Outlaw, just some ridahs on our own mission
The trite and true, we un-fuck-with-a-ble
It's critical, the game change, we stay the same
A lot of shit y'all doin now, I did when I was seventeen
And that's the truth if I ever heard it
Hard time, sometime, but I know it's gonna be worth this shit
We done got it together, we gonna party together
They try to stop what we doin, we give em 'Hell man whatever'
Shit this how a live nigga do it, ride or die nigga blew it
We don't try nigga, lose it
And let em know not to fuck with you
And touch your boo, bust your tooth, hush them fools
Chorus

Uh, a big dick to stroke
I ain't braggin, I'm just lettin you know
Uh, and ever sicne you bounced on me, baby I've been ready to go
Uh, and we can keep this between us
Nut with nothin much to discuss
Uh, or we can let it out to the world
Make a boy or a girl, it's on us
Baby, I like it when you show me your tongue
Lick on my balls until I cum and yell 'stop, stop'
Uh, and when I blow on your clit
Stick my thumb where you shit, you get hot
Damn, nasty, plus you got a big old ass
That pop like a gun, go 'blast, blast'
And you think your girl was fucked
Always talkin all that jazz
So don't fuck with me
I'm not the nigga you love
I'm just the nigga you fuck
I ain't the nigga to her
Chorus
 
 
 
Loyalty....
Some of yall niggas dont even know what the fuck that is
A whole lot of niggas (yeah)
Some of yall niggas'll never know Loyalty
Wanna hate on me?
Nigga fuck you and yo family
I stay true to what I know and thats Outlaw (who?)
It ain't no me in this muthafucka without yall
We went from nothing to something
Hustlin' and bubblin'
And ain't ask niggas for nothin' (shit)
Shit that made other cliqs I split
Made us tighter
Fuck the industry
Cause I ain't no dick rider
You see me nigga
I ain't lost a pound
Still eatin', still breathin'
Still reackin' off that cali shit
And I ain't never want muthafuckas to handle shit
You see me pushin' .22's?
Nigga handle it
Feelin' good like we just won a championship
New money, new label
Keep it crackin' bitch
And I'ma get the last laugh
You can count on it
And stay away from you mutherfuckas that's counterfeit
Loyalty..................... snitch ass nigga

Somethin' bout loyalty
It always avoided me
As far as my eyes can see
I can only depend on me
What's loyalty?

It's like a jungle sometimes
We keep on hustlin'
But they wanna take us under, under, under

God damn I'm glad you set it off
Used to be hard
Now you just went soft
Poison, young nigga, bitch to society
Once had love for em
Why the fuck he lied to me?
Kicked out the crew cause his soul ain't strong
Started sniffin' herion
Nigga you wrong
And I ain't never hang around fag ass niggas
Rappin niggas alseep in the county ass niggas
My family strong like the mafia
It ain't no thang to put a slug thru ya
Scary ass nigga
Damy ass nigga
Won't throw rice in a wedding ass nigga
Loyalty

I can't stand the fake and the snake never
Worse the betrayal
You scared of the heat muthafucka?
Stay away from the barrel
And I ain't never been a rat
Or been scared to ride
A lot of niggas act tough
But know they pie inside
Death before dishonor
But you really scared to die
We could spit a verse about you
We put yo life on the line
Military mind ain't never put his nose on the line
A real souljah never retreats
When it's time for a crime

Hey yo....
You can talk that shit
But how many of yall can do what we did?
Muthafuckas talkin' bout the Lawz ain't shit
Bitch ass nigga should get off the Lawz dick
Muthafuckas mad that we got our own label
Outlaw Recordz, we ain't fuckin with you haters
Niggas know the Lawz been holdin' this down
If you dont see him now
We dont fuck with that clown
Loyalty... (uhuh)

Somethin' bout loyalty
It always avoided me
As far as my eyes can see
I can only depend on me
What's loyalty?

It's like a jungle sometimes
We keep on hustlin'
But they wanna take us under, under, under

What's Loyalty?
When a nigga say he love you
But all awhile he dont think nothin' of you
And that's just what love do
Stab ya in the heart
Grab you in the dark
And rip families apart
Damn... we was supposed to be fam
We had plans
Now I claim to understand you
I guess life is a gamble
I shook the dice
But I betted on the peasent
Then I took a dive
Like oohhhhh....
How come I ain't know
I should've seen it was simply soul
Now I know.... what's loyalty
It's all clear to me
These words is for the birds
You ain't real to me
Life is a liar
Got me spinning like the tires
Hug a drunk driver, back and forth
You ain't ready and you petty
So I laugh it off
But it's a cost to be the boss
You gon' pay for not being loyal

My life's a blessin'
My life's a lesson
And if it's ride or die
There ain't no question
Ain't no time for second guessin'
We ain't bustas
Niggas ain't new to this shit
We some muthafuckin' ridahs
And yall niggas is the opposite
I sense bitch like a dog sense fear
So yall better act right
Anytime that I'm near
Live in yo ear
Everyone's a ridah in here
Cross game
Watch them ridahs appear
Muthafucka

Somethin' bout loyalty
It always avoided me
As far as my eyes can see
I can only depend on me
What's loyalty?
 
 
 
It's only us, me, Kastro, EDI and Napoleon
It's on again, young niggas born again
I wish somebody coulda told me then
That we was gon' grow up to be some lonely men
Now I found out I really don't got friends
Cause nobody come around when I not spend
I walk around this fuckin planet feelin boxed in
Smokin stoge after stoge like it's oxygen
When there was 10 of us we all ate from one dub
Let's turn the dirt to glory for Pac up above
Yak one love, I know you gotta be free
Havin conversations with you when there's nobody but me
I guess whatever don't kill me make me stronger
But I don't know if I can take it any longer
But I got to, cause family live they dreams through us
It's like 5 million lost souls that cling to us
But I know one thing, it ain't shit without y'all
Thug Life for life, Young Noble Outlaw
It ain't shit without y'all
Thug Life for life, Young Noble Outlaw

The only thing that we got left is us
If you don't have nothin else, son, you got my trust
Loyalty come first, I put my life in your hands
I'ma die as a man and die together is the plan
Keep the team stong, make this cream real long
Cash last long enough for our grandkids to eat on
We Outlawz, and if it's on then it's on
Watch my back, I watch yours and we make it through the strorm
Thug on

Early on I knew life wasn't shit
Just made 2, drugs and love made my daddy split
Mama's now forced to turn a boy into a man
Impossible task, still she doin all she can
And I'm growin quickly, slowly started seein things
All the wrong in this world, taught me not to believe in things
Not even man, cause we all change daily
Best friends be tryin to bring each other death quickly
Only the strong survive
As long as I'm alive I ride
Hooked up with some niggas that I knew had my side
O-u-t-l-a-w-z
Me for you, you for me eternally
Makaveli-trained riders
Cause the Don may be gone but he remains deep inside us
It comes out every time niggas try us
Y'all my family until the Lord'll have me I make this promise


I been wakin up, stressin lately
Sheets wet from the sweat and my hands shaky
I got a kid on the way, I'm kinda nervous
I did some dirt in my life, hope it don't curse it
And all I got left is my Outlaw niggas
My cousins and my brothers and some Jersey drug dealers
I keep my faith in the Lord and stay strugglin
He keep on pushin me forward to stay hustlin
And when Pac died nobody never knew
Or gave a fuck on what the Outlawz was goin through
We kept your heads to the sky and our guns too
We had to ask straight for a dollar to split a cold brew
And through the process our family was still dyin
I got a grip of this shit, there's no complyin
And I'ma be the solid rock that I am, nigga
And I'ma give it all I got to raise my kid, nigga
I got the blood of Malcolm X in me
I got the dirt from the cemetary runnin in me
One way up and that's how we goin, nigga
Now put guns up, the world ain't friendly, nigga
And just wait till you get to hold reality
And just wait, I bet you try to up your salary
And these crackers be doin too much
Let's start the revolution so we can rise up
Come on

Thug on
Thug on
Thug on
Outlawz till I die, gee
Pour some liquor on the curb
 
 
 
Time after time niggas thinkin' we gon' fold
We ain't yo average niggas
I don' told you once before
All my real niggas know
We been at it for years
Persevering and still here
Through static and tears
And yeah..
We some ridahs -- No
It ain't no stoppin' us
They couldn't stop us
So... they tried copying
But out of living color in the flesh
Guess who's back
Nigga act like you know what's good for ya

These industry niggas man they more like bitches
These fuckin' rappers man they more like snitches
Been in the cut and we been focusing, listening
And everybody got a story to tell
But why they twistin' them?
So keep ya head right (head right)
You want the raw on the Lawz
You gotta log-on the muthafuckin' website
(what's that?)
And that's OutlawRecordz.Net
Show some respect
Cause real niggas go for the net

Don't get it fucked up, fucked up
Nigga don't get it, get it
Fucked up, Fucked up
Nigga don't get it, get it
Fucked up, fucked up
Nigga don't get it, get it
Fucked up
Bitches don't get it, get it
Fucked Up
Snitches don't get it, get it
Fucked up
Don't get it fucked up, fucked up
Nigga don't get it, get it
Fucked up, Fucked up
Nigga don't get it, get it
Fucked up, fucked up
Nigga don't get it, get it
Fucked up
Bitches don't get it, get it
Fucked Up
Snitches don't get it, get it
Fucked up

Who wanna ride?
Who wanna drive?
Who wanna die?
Who wanna roll up
Load up and dump at the same time
We all different but the same kind
All my niggas on a mission that's the same as mine
Blame the times
We all spent days in line
Now we all at the front of the bus
Blames the rhymes, I
Aim the Nine, I
Came to shine, I
Thank the Lord and my heavenly father

We got to get it right back
To where we started from
This for my niggas strugglin'
Comin' out of the slum
If you ain't ridin' on twinkies
You could still ride with me
If you ain't blingin' like I'm blingin'
You could still ride with me
Cause it ain't what you got
It's what ya know
Outlaw muthafucka, untouchable
Give 'em the truth
Or get out the booth
That's my new shit
Cause rapper's now-a-days
Y'all been makin' us all look stupid


Shit, I been doin' what I wanted for some time now
Shit, I wanted as a kid
All mine now  (it's all mine now)
I ain't lucked up  (noooo)
Don't get it fucked up  (noooo)
Look what years of stugglin' did
Wanted for something
The kid real, like one in a Mil'
Cash of kings
Without a deal or a chain that bling
I'm a Outlaw  (outlaw)
But I don't rob
And when times got hard
I ain't get no job
Shit I got it how I live
Spit it like it is
And did it all for the kid (yes sir)
I'm a ridah homeboy
I ride on chrome boy
And I refuse to die right besides my chrome boy
 
 
 
(Verse 1-E.D.I. Mean)
But we the last motha fuckaz breathin
You don't beleive us then watch us ya tuned in
To them Outlaw ridaz, block survivors
Killa Kadafi beside us
Reppin that thug shit until they bury or hide us
Tellin all of my street souljah's to rise up
From East to West Coast yo, don't let 'em stop ya
It's a cold, hard way we livin
Can't out just me, and live to smoke a little
Watch my children grow a little
Get this money, escape the prison
My jail niggas doin time I feel ya pain, get out rise
It ain't nothin but a come up
Outlaw Recordz it's official street niggas gettin this money legal
We all in together now, ballin together now
Secrets of war young busta you better learn about
Bust, if you must, plus
Get in the business when the jealous niggas fuck with us
(Chorus-Kastro)
We was taught, at all costs hold down fort
And let the Lord be the judge in this all out court
Where money, power, guns is boss
And countin big funs is the favorite sport
We must rise, maximize our size
Look alive, be advised it's a war outside
It's like dodge city, not pretty
But don't nobody notice it really you feel me, we must rise
(Verse 2-Napoleon)
Pause nigga 'fore these shells fall with ya
'Bout to four fifth ya, still don't get the picture
Thuggin on 'em actin sleep when I'm plottin on 'em
This little bitty bullet will make his body turn rotten on 'em
Sick them rottweiler's on him, did snatch some dollars from him
Bling bling that punk nigga, take the diamonds from him
Never had no love for him, nigga we solo
Passin out bullets like they promo
Oh no, Outlawz comin through
Nothin but trouble too, we still do the shit that Pac used to do
Who would of knew, that I'd be pointin guns at you
Takin funs from you, makin fun at you
Busta, ain't nothin but a Jersey ride nigga
Have my fanny so white, enough to sniff lines nigga
Napoleon, a.k.a Maximus
My plans for this, is rise up, stack chips, nigga rise
(Chorus-Kastro)
We was taught, at all costs hold down fort
And let the Lord be the judge in this all out court
Where money, power, guns is boss
And countin big funs is the favorite sport
We must rise, maximize our size
Look alive, be advised it's a war outside
It's like dodge city, not pretty
But don't nobody notice it really you feel me, we must rise
(Verse 3)
(Young Noble)
Addicted to adrenaline rush
That the streets give off from 5-0 when the heat bust off
And I paint it the same cuz I mastermind
And every game ain't the same gotta change with the times
And get left behind, blessed by God
The judge tryin to stretch the charge
Young niggas gotta rise up fuck the narcs
Motha fuckaz can't take orders
You ain't a souljah nigga don't blame Noble
It's the life of ya kid 25 to life bid
Four five to wig, dyin tryin to live
The streets is a restin place and yesterday
And nigga ain't no such thing as extra pay
So give me mine today, and get yours tomorrow
Nigga Pac left the Thug Life love to follow
And I'm O-U-T loyal 'till my casket drop
Hustle hard 'till it's hard for the cash to stop, we must rise
(Big Syke)
Makaveli Kadafi, meant to Big Kato
Only ridaz in this day that's killin willin and able
Gang related incorporated, you can't fade it
Haters gotta hate and ridaz glad that we made it
Make it take it to the next level
Now change the game, fuck the fame
Bang 'em scrape on the hang
It ain't no thang to rise above the rest
Pass any test, you mention Thug Life you mention the best
So invest in a vest, come bang with the best
The sunrise in the East but my set in the West
Still risin for my nigga Stretch, keep a tech
My paper stay risin whether cash or check
(Chorus-Kastro)
At all costs hold down fort
And let the Lord be the judge in this all out court
Where money, power, guns is boss
And countin big funs is the favorite sport
We must rise, maximize our size
Look alive, be advised it's a war outside
It's like dodge city, not pretty
But don't nobody notice it really you feel me, we must rise
 
 
 
 (talking)
Hmm, damn, I feel ya
Turn, nope, don't nobody care
These Outlawz feel y'all (yup)
Yeah, don't nobody care
Sometime it get like that (When it feel like don't nobody care)
It seems like nobody care (nope, not nobody)
I care though, listen

I been so sick lately, bellyin and not achy
These issues keep me with pistols for safety
I got plans that the cops ain't included in
And not a handcuff or shell could hold em in
Right at the end of my road, who been there before?
Now that I'm dead, it's like I've been dead before
Same story, it's raw, I'm an outlaw
A bread warhead, K-Dogg is a warrior
And when I stand, I stand on my own two
If I fall, I land on my own two
A soldier, and it been like that
Pac and Yak see us now and they could see all that
Who really care? Fuck the tarry hair
And the rest of the Outlawz was without a share
Don't nobody care, just like I thought
So I just stare at the world like I don't give a fuck

I remember them days when it was dark outside
The only thing I felt I had was my nuts and my pride
I was different than them niggas on the block sellin drugs
But I was always with em, actin like a thug
Runnin through the mud cause the cops was on us
We just walkin home from school but they always on us
It's like this, the streets is so lovely
I love the streets, because the streets made me
The ghetto seems so in peace
Man, that I moved to the suburbs and there's more police
Where I'm from, a fiend'll pack a gun
Overton, Jersey the harder the slum
But I made it up outta there, thanks to the Lord, kid
But I'll never leave my box alone, nigga I swear (swear)
And to the young kids wearin the streets do
I know nobody don't care, but the Outlawz do (cause we do)

We stack clips, glack licks in the air
Smoke sticks on the stairs, dog, nobody care (nobody care)
We shot the fear when everybody was there
Beat each other half to death, but homie nobody care (nobody care)
My momma wasn't there and my poppa wasn't there
Couldn't find em anywhere cause nobody cared, yeah
We split mills, pop pills and shit
Ten on the floor, ten in the bed, damn, nobody care

Yo, hard times as a youngsta
Scarred by the hunger, wonder
How many gonna die this summer (die this summer)
We loud like thunder roamin the strip
Now everybody act cool, we approachin the vip (come on, come on)
Smokin a stick, hit, cause we live for this (live for this)
Just like shit is hard raisin kids in this
I got 'Outlaw' tatted on my stomach and all (stomach and all)
We can fight and hang out later like nothing is wrong
Laise your Timms up tight cause the ride is rough (uh)
You can tighten my cuffs, I'm still likin the cuffs (come on)
Fuck this and that, cause I'mma get you back (uh-huh)
I know you mother fuckers sick and wish that I couldn't rap
Hatin already waitin till my pockets is fat (uh)
Would you rather see me incarcerated, locked in the back? (come on)
Cockin a strap, have your whole block in a gat (yeah)
Every body down flat, where them dollars at? (uh, oh yeah)

I put my faith in the Lord, pray for patience in war
Now only time'll tell if he heard me before
I see myself in the mirror, young nigga full of flaws
But in the streets, I'm a hero cause I give it to em raw
I'm just my momma's second son, and I just bought me a gun
Cause some niggas want some, and I ain't got nothin for em
Me and my niggas stay hungry, strivin for the old and gray money
Ridin while these niggas think it's funny
But ain't a damn thing funny to a nigga like me (nah)
When you sittin on your ass broke and thirty
And don't nobody care about your sob story (nah)
I work so hard homie, you better be about your money (homie)
Oh yeah, it goes both ways, and momma used to say
'The Lord'll help those who help themselves'
I keep my eyes on the prize so there ain't no chance for me fail
Cause don't nobody give a fuck when you livin in hell
Chorus x 2
 
 
 
White tee money gang
We staying with the fitted on
Pockets on rose, ? tryna get it on
Lounging, 
dirty Sprite, even dirtier
Thoughts on how to come up on a Thursday night
If it ain't about bread I don't
Kick no knowledge
. 
You wanna learn something?
Take your broke ass to college
I ain't a role model, crack don't stop
Money then we money grabbing back up top
But naw, I ain't flashing mine, see me
Flash my rings, waving a hammer
Like a glass of wine. What else?
It's MOE, I told the judge I ain't budge
It's either him or me

One way in, one way out
In this hood, you gotta plan your way out
Streets is a maze, if you make it out
Just tryna get paid, it's a
Muthafuckin drought. It's so easy
To be all about my money living
In these days, niggas tryna get
Something from me, but no..
I know, I know..

Sucka niggas is blonde bimbos
Edie Hathaway, I'm jumping out the window
Act like the beats dropping like Timbo
Land like we flying, 
crash like cymbals
Look here, I'm bossed up in my Outlaw
Outwear, telling niggas out my chair
Yeah, warrior shit and ain't a foot
In glorious shit, getting to the money
Down to get more of this shit
Cause we hustle all day and all night
And we ain't stopping til we get it right
C'mon! Cause we hustle all day and all night
And we ain't stopping til we get it right
Shorty, better than I could tell you
If you really from the hood
Every ghetto is familiar
Everybody struggling, everybody hustling
Tryna make ends' meet, gotta lay out 6 feet
On your knees, I'mma get a list
I ain't trickin on these bitches
With a stack of my business
Let's get it! When you doing good
Everybody fucking with you
When that drought hit, ain't
Nobody fucking with you
I'm just tryna paint a picture here
So you could see. Real niggas can make it
It's up to you and me
Tryna find thoughts, insane, no love
In the land of the lost
I'mma get mine

One way in, one way out
In this hood, you gotta plan your way out
Streets is a maze, if you make it out
Just tryna get paid, it's a
Muthafuckin drought. It's so easy
To be all about my money living
In these days, niggas tryna get
Something from me, but no..

The birds fly South, but I was headed North
Watching while my parents dealing with divorce
Also was watching Diddy chilling in The Source
Thinking that I'm about to get it
Bout to kill a corpse. They say the court
Was the better way to get abortion
I said of course, but everybody isn't good at sports
Can't get endorsed when you always
Sitting in the courts
And anyway, the money love me like it's intercourse
So now I gotta get a voice
I gotta hop up out the hoopty and
Go get a Royce
, government make you
Feel like you don't get a choice, pass the torch
And when we coming for you ?
 
 
 
Y'all don't understand
Y'all want to, but cha don't though
This ain't what I planned
This is who I am
(I am, this is who I am)
(I am, this is who I am)
I look up to greed
I ain't sayin' nothin' strange
My feelin's ain't changed
My feelin's ain't changed
No - no -- no - no
I ain't rappin', no
I look up to him
We got mo' laps to go
Understand? Naw, y'all don't understand
Pac made a nigga watch like a peep hole
Banger, that's my bigga' brotha'
I put it on my mother
I swear we need each other
(I swear we need each other)
Im just a real nigga talkin'
Real talk til I lay up in the coffin
And I'll handle my hat
And I'll gamble my stratch
Til I get mine back
It's just me dawg

They don't understand
Why the fuck we do what we do
They don't understand
Why the fuck we keep it so true
They don't understand
Why the fuck we just don't give a fuck
They don't understand
When they see a nigga comin' up
They don't understand
They don't understand
They don't understand
But I don't give a damn, no
They don't understand
They don't understand
They don't understand
But I don't give a damn, no

Picture my mission
I'm in it to get it
One nigga yellin' FUCK THE WORLD
Homey that's how I live it
Strapped up
Us against the world
That's how we did it
I'm like fuck 'em
If they don't understand they ain't with us
They ain't in this
We them Outlaw souljahs
They them other niggas that be rollin wit the row
Ya snitch
Y'all can kill my pride
If ya want it
The shit is in my veins
My blood streams is hunted
How could you not understand a nigga like me
How could you not understand living like a 'G'
It's who you be
I don't know about you
But the shit I'm puttin' down on these beats
Motherfucker it's true
No need to sugar-coat it
Or pussy deep stone it
My shit is so real
That's why the streets want it
Squares don't understand
That's why they hate on it
I'm like FUCK 'EM
They ain't stoppin' my chips
Hell naw niggaaaa


They don't understand
Man it's deeper then the music
Overstand what I'm sayin' to ya
(nigga just listen to me)
And when I die
Y'all keep on mashin'
Makaveli in our blood
We laced with his ashes
Got the mind of the militant
The heart of a souljah
Got the spirit of a struggla'
I know why God lovin' us
And all the glory is his
(all the glory is his)
They said we couldn't
But I knew we could win
With my back against the wall
Hands tied behind my back
When you got God on ya team
Young Outlaw king, I mean
Gotta feel it, don't hate it
Gotta respect it, we made it
And young niggas worldwide related
To some shit that I was sayin' from the bottom of my heart
They felt like we felt
Tryna get some light
We in the dark
(they don't understand -- stand)
All the shit we been through
(but if you understand)
You went through something similar too
Ya feel me dawg
 
 
 
 (talking)
Outlawz... could never touch the kids in the ghetto man
That's where I'm from..... man

This is our life
Even tho' the sun dont always shine
It's still our life
If you keep yo head up everything will be alright
In living your life

I'm damn near 'bout to go in tears
Writin' this verse here
I feel like I'm cursed here
I'm choked up since I lost my peers
But I know one day we be back again
One love to my Mexicans
Tryin' to run across the border
To see freedom all over again
Man... One love to my Africans
They try to kill us with AIDS
But they smart again
It's like I die once that I be born again
With the grace of Allah
Kept away my sins
From the ghetto where they play with heavy metal to win
Lost my parents so I moved with my next-of-kin
Life.... just so mych pain to me
To tell the truth I dont wanna die angrily
Makaveli and Kadafi, them trained me
I feel yall in the dark steady hatin' me

This is our life
Even tho' the sun dont always shine
It's still our life
If you keep yo head up everything will be alright
In living your life

In '96 we was on top of the world
Videos, movies, money, jewels and girls
Rolls Royces, Hummers, Jagz and all that
Hard to believe one night in Vegas changed all that
Fast forward... 6 years
Man, we still here
Despite be hated on (huh)
We still clear
Until the end of time you can't stop destiny
Back for everything they owe
Now let's go

I got the spirit of a angel
The heart of a soldier
The mind of a militant
Was blessed by my mother
The inspiration of my life
She 4 years clean
With 15 years on the pipe
And she just got married
I felt pain... ya sayin' Pac smilin' at the wedding
Never forget her mah'
Yall baby fool, I promise to ya I'mma stay a trooper
Outlawz done die
We forever move

This is our life
Even tho' the sun dont always shine
It's still our life
If you keep yo head up everything will be alright
In living your life

Oh... I'm on, pens and needles
Needles and pens
These 2 Tims was my Beemer
Before I heard of a Benz
I got lost tryin' to find my ends
And got crossed tryin' to find me a friend
That's life....
We sacrifice for better days
We pray for a better way that never came
Hey! (hey.. hey)
What's more precious then a innocent child, smilin'
??? was foul, look at his smile
School's not cool
Them big body rules
The workin' mans a fool
If he can't afford the jewels
Look at how life use ya
Abuse and confuse ya
Remember we was suppose to be the future?
Now we grown
The future is here and we gone
Oh where did we go wrong
Let's live...
And do right by these kids my friend
They the only shot we got at living life again
C'mon

This is our life
Even tho' the sun dont always shine
It's still our life
If you keep yo head up everything will be alright
In living your life
 
 
 
So many tears I cried, so many tears
So much pain inside, so much pain
But baby it ain't over, it ain't over till we say so
So many years we tried, so many years
Keep on our love, keep in it alive
But baby it ain't over, it ain't over till we say so

So many years I had grinding my new...
Ain't here no fat lady singing till... hit the streets
So many tears, from so many tears, it's crying
So many tears they're from too many beers, I'm trying
I think I can, I know I can, I'm like that little train
Explain the same stories to my old man
I tell my daughter only head up high
And when talking to anybody, looking them in the eye
You got to roll on, life goes on, for every in a day
And know the change's gonna come, but never in a day
Longer as you getting your money,.. in a way
But you can smile instead of crying finding better days
Hey, see, it ain't over till it's over, you hear me
And the... just don't fit me, you gotta roll on, life goes on, for every in a day
And know the change's gonna come, but never in a day


Yeah, live it up or give it up, that's the outlaw model
Honor and loyalty that's the code that I follow
We're from the blocks, swanging them bottles, living out rap life
Banging them top models, and pushing in top throttle
My life is like a novel, better yet
Autobiography... fresh out the dog bible
Fourth corner gang... going for the title
The mission is survival, gotta outsmart...
Lest, to be the last motherfucker breathing with stress
A lot of my real niggers ain't breathing
Still outlawz immortalz we ain't never leaving
Pushing forward into orbit, it's the new season
Get used to it, the flow is real music
Never give up against rough niggers stick to it
It's like I'm better under pressure back against the wall
This ship forever hommie, I'm a die an outlawz


She left me dog, took the kids and hit the road on me
This house is mad, I'm almost solo
Too many nights kicking backup in the street clubs
And vip with the girls
I can explain what this dirty gang did to me
Seeing me is for the 10 days to 23
I'm on a roll with the hottest... in the gang
Chicks don't even know my name...
You are home with the kids while I'm out in street
Wondering where I am at, ready to kill me
I know... better knew, better dumb, better dumb, damn
You ain't even leaving the... let it go
And I'm so set in my ways I seen it coming
Matter of fact, I put my foot on the gap and kept it running
It's like I had to have you, now I'm sitting with the...
Hope a Lenny Kravitz scene from it
 
 
 
Everything
Is gon' be alright
You know?
This is for my young thug Kamillion
Cause we told him, man
Yeah
We told him he's comin back

The dawn comes after the night
And there's a silver lining surrounding every cloudy day
Seems like hard times been a friend of mine I can't shake
Still I rise with a clique of thugs they can't break
Pain mixed with rain and no sunshine
And all we wanted was to be happy just one time
We had no choice, no voice, only our faith in God
And the hunger to hustle and get this paper, Lord
Out in the cold, lost souls, nowhere to go
Hooked up with Jay  then we found a home
See, with y'all on the side the world can be against ya
And they still gon' lose, that's the realer
Feel us, we ain't killers, we just riders for the have-nots
Cause some of us ain't got it all, tucked in a stash spot
Oh yes, we're back, baby, run and tell a friend
Let em witness how we get us through this hell again
Come on

Everything is gonna be alright
We coming back
Like we said we would
Everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

Our life is like a gunfight, hard to love life
No hope and no light, dark in the sunlight
Dodge and duck ( ? )
I hate to question you God, but I ask you Lord
Is you comin back just like they said you would?
I need you here now, I'm yo child, it ain't good
But I'ma keep my faith in you and that's the truth
We live fading us, thugged out without a clue
Waitin for revolution, with a love for shootin
At each other, even brothers kill each other stupid
And that's the way it been since I could remember
Born into a storm 3rd day of December
1976 I shot in the mix
Popped out mommy twat, how did it come to this?
I know my God love me and that's a real fact
He ain't gone for long, my dog comin back

Everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
Like he said he would
Everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

Pac, why you leave us? This world don't need us
But when we tell em you here they don't believe us
My Black Jesus, the only one that tried to free us
Nobody cared but you took time to teach us
Bear with me even though it seems my heart empty
Somethin's always missin without y'all with me
2Pac and Yafeu, I pray to you
And still we live every day for you
I'ma stay loyal till I'm dead and gone
Outlaw till I die so forever it's on
Use my body as a vehicle
It lead a soldier through the storm, I believe in you
Stayin true to everything you worked for
Hurt for, had fingers in the dirt for
I know it's worth it, Lord
Cause Yak watch every step I make
You gon' live on, soldier, every breath I take
You still here
You still here
You gon' live on, soldier, every breath I take
You still here

Everything is gonna be alright
They coming back
Like we said they would
Everything is gonna be alright
They coming back
For the true and good
Everything is gonna be alright
We coming back
Like we said we would
Everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good
Everything's gonna be alright
We're comin back
 
 
 
 (talking)
Yeah, from the bottom
For the depths, for the bottom
We come from there, but we still here
We still breath, so long as we got air in these lungs *exhale*
We gonna get something, no matter how, no matter what
Listen

Yo, my whole block family, we all argue and fight
But if you not family, keep talkin alright?
Will you get them Nikes? Oh you like them yeah?
They look good on me, you wanna cop a pair
Though it takes some time, we still love everybody
Them like my thug sisters, so I'm fuckin every mommy
Everybody know my face, everybody know my name
As I walk through I heard em sayin 'Noble do his thing'
I'm flowin through this game like I'm slidin on ice
Brought these niggas insane like I'm slidin in dice
Applyin the wife, but ain't nobody dyin tonight
We fryin the rice, dinner on the steps tonight
I bet your life I just might stretch your wife
Stretch your dime, stretch your doe, and stretch your time
It might sound short, then I'll stretch the rhyme
Nothin but another day, know I ain't gonna lie

I still remember when a nigga didn't have a thang
Curb surfin on the corner each and every day (every day)
For all the people cause I never find a better way
Ain't gonna stop me from hittin when I see some paper (I'm gettin it nigga)
Somebody tell me what's the price for a better day
But it don't matter, I'm gonna get mine anyway
But in the scene It's like I still hear my feet the same
Can we get paid? just want to get paid

Man I wasn't born with it
But I'm gonna get it
Let it be known I'm on a mission
]From boss livin, no bullshittin'
And I don't sit around in this who don't want nothin
And I don't kick it with these bitches who always want somethin
I'm my own man, own plan, been that way
Lost my father, shit got harder man, and since that day
I never ever really trust the world again
Age ten, feel frustration
No patience when it all forego
Fuck takin it slow
I'd rather take it and blow
I still roll daily
Only stoppin for my babies
I'm a hard=luck nigga
Keep your guard up nigga
Large cut getta
I gotta have my piece
I'll chop it up with ya man
But I gotta have my piece
You cannot be mad at me
I'm game tight on all sides
Obstacles cannot damage my pride
I manage to ride, but be it wasn't easy
Young struggla, livin for the love of us
Outlaw
Chorus

I'm bluntin, so I'm strapped, and I'm starred and cautious
Ain't nothin but a day at the office
I stand alone so I cut my losses
And sometimes I drink until I feel nauseous (ha)
It's not easy, believe me, it's no fun
Still I chase my paper, till I can't run
And I was still just a kid till I had one
If not for bad luck, I probably wouldn't have nothin
It's two G's and I just can't quit yet
Through all they mind so I just can't sit back
I stand strong so you know I don't get checked
The born Outlaw so you know I ain't wit' that
My younger days in the day tryin to figure out
A million ways to get paid in a bigger amount
I ain't a mystery, it's elementary
Cash rules, and that's the way it was meant to be

Eat now, I'm kinda low in the pockets
House lookin like shit, volts is climbin out the sockets
But that's how it is in twenty-three a.m
Brick City, N-J
Besides Cali, it's the home of the A-K
I'm paid to roll, was raised too low
But at least in my heart, I've always felt alone
I stayed strong through all the times I supposed to
I pray to God daily, you barely when you supposed to
Close to the money cause it's close to my heart
In my life, death ain't nothin but a walk in the park
Hard times gettin sweeter now
I guess Allah must have blessed us cause we eatin now
Come on

(TQ = Can I get paid X 3)
Reminiscin of the days we was broke man (broke man)
We still missin tryin to get it, it's a sure thang (sure thang)
The forecast for today said it's gonna rain (gonna rain)
Heat showers on the block, still we gonna hang (gonna hang)
Live yours, and you know I'm tryin to live mine (live mine)
Get yours, cause I ain't tryin to give mine (give mine)
Everybody comin out at the same time (same time)
Nothin but another day, know I can't lie
Reminiscin of the days we was broke man (broke man)
Heat showers on the block, still we gonna hang (still we gonna hang)
 
 
 
I got this monkey on my back
And I can't let it go
So much trouble on my brain
And I can't let it go
Oh, and I'm so throed
I don't know what to do
But pour me a drank
And smoke a blunt or two
And let it burn
Let it burn (5x)
Motherfucker.. We
Let it burn (6x)
All my soldiers
Let it burn

Spark up a cigarette
You talkin' the biggest threat
You mention my set
Resurrect my life through death
I walk around with the dirtiest boots
Camouflage the suit
We them soldiers that you gotta salute
26 years full of Donald Goines material
Pour water in my cereal
Don't worry it'll get us through
We never complained
We weathered the rain
Stayed loyal to the thug core
Respecting the game
I'm just a New Street nigga
With a lil' bit of fame
Picture me rhyming
Motherfuck nickel and dimin'
On some coke shit
My clips went for 80 a watts
Raw, until that cook got, gravy the cop
And goin' home, stoppin' ya fun
When Yak got killed
If you grew up with a nigga don't that make 'em ya friend
I see the world through a foggy lens
With a Fo'-Five buried in my baggy jeans
Even my mom dukes was a naggin' fiend
I thank God she like 6 or 7 years clean
If you believe then you can achieve anything
Try the measure the price of life thru a triple-beam
And let it burn


I ain't stressin' no bitches
I'm out here stressin' my riches
And these 5-dolla niggas bout to turn me into a killer
My friend is my pen
My only homey is my lonely thoughts
Ridin' thru the city with a gage bout to blow it off
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high probably try to blow my brains out
Why??
Cause mama need her medicine
My kids gotta eat
Labels playin' hella games
Boy don't fuck around with me
If it ain't one thing it's a motherfuckin 'notha
Word to my granny, and my daddy and my mother
But I ain't no sucka
I'ma let it -- let it burn
Get back on my two feet and swerve


I lost my head with a family
And these niggas astounding
That I'm back up off my feet dawg
But I'm still sitting down
Yeah I'm paralyzed
So it's just a half of me
And my father dead too
So I'm a bastard 'G'
I'm bout to hit this rap game
Get the cash and flee
And I'm forever with my motherfuckin family
This billy bang Outlawz hard, listen me
And yeah we'll burn you bout the legacy of P-A-C

I'm a dawg, but I don't roll over (wroof!)
I might stumble but I don't fall over (wroof!)
A whole patron, money gone, hung over (wroof!)
Never ever my level, one over (wroof!)
I gotta shake the devil off my shoulder (wroof!)
And never will I settle, I'm a soldier (wroof!)
All the time is the time to make the donuts (wroof!)
Ya feel that
Then light another stouge up
And let it burn
 
 
 
Ain't nothin but hoes in here

All the little homies postin' near
Thug walkin' to the dance floor while I'm chokin' a beer
I got a little hot mama with a lot of dollaz

Bringin' it back to the ways that were cold-hearted

You gon' croak
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
You know a million people die everyday
Breathin' in second hand smoke
You gon' croak
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
Did you know a million people die everyday
Breathin' second hand smoke

I'm like a ball of smoke
Blown from a crackpipe
Into the hands of the street
My.. father to be since the age of 5
Real cold you gotta be just to stay alive
We the second hand smoke of a fiend generation
Swear we will
But they know we won't make it
Smoking a ciggarete
Breathin' ya last breath
Tasting my own death
Rest on my home steps
And just vision all the karma and all the drama
Inherited the pain of a lost father
Heavy black raining
With no umbrella
Life's like a dice game
You can throw whatever
And it might not be in your favor
And now ya worst enemy becomes ya neighbor
And that's life
Everything happens twice
Breathin' second hand smoke from my ancestors' pipes
(God help us)

Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
You know a million people die everyday
Breathin' in second hand smoke
You gon' croak
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
Did you know a million people die everyday
Breathin' second hand smoke

The streets dog gave birth
Another nutty baby
Plus the son of a ghetto widow might make him crazy
On his own since he 16
Turning the block out
Sleep in the crack house
Making his cash routes
Fiendin' on the side
This nigga scheming on the side
This nigga....
Cream is always on his mind
Ain't been the same since he bought that .9
Promised him a life of crime
But he ain't been the same since he bought that .9
He was once a child of god
But he ain't been the same since he bought that .9
Listen to me closely
I'ma tell you how it roast me
He's a victim of second hand smoke and choking
It's only cause he lonely cause his father ain't home
Became a victim of the gunsmoke..... he gone (damn)
Second hand smoke

Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
You know a million people die everyday
Breathin' in second hand smoke
You gon' croak
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
Did you know a million people die everyday
Breathin' second hand smoke

I'm all the way real
And you could see it in my grill
And I can't chill
Too much my blood don' spilled
I give you the deal
Just to see if you can feel
I grind for mines
I don't cheat and I don't steal
I'm about a half a mil from a half a mil
And I'd still be this real without a rapper deal
And thus.... I fight a truck for a pot of luck
And bite dust so my kids don't hurt this much
We come a long way
Still we got lots to learn
We.... toss and turn like a roster burn
So I'm concerned
Youngster, I'm still amongst ya
We grew up in the sewer
Raised up in the dumpsters
It's like we all suffer for somebody other
Born from my daddy to my baby mother
All my folks
All born with high hopes
Crying.... dying from second hand smoke

You gon' croak
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
Did ou know a million people die everyday
Breathin' second hand smoke
You gon' croak
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
Did you know a million people die everyday
Breathin' second hand smoke
 
 
 
 (talking)
Black Rain, there's no chance to escape it
You know it seem like sometimes, there's nothin but bad luck?
It just won't go right, that's the black rain, you know? Uh-huh

Black Rain, don't come down
Don't you come fallin
Black Rain, don't come down
Now don't you come fallin
Black Rain, Black Rain, don't come
You've been wettin us up from day one
We ain't never see a high point, how come
Black Rain, Black Rain comes under the sun
Oh Black Rain, Black Rain, don't come
You've been wettin us up from day one
We ain't never see a high point, how come
Black Rain, Black Rain comes under the sun

We live those big money dreams
A six scene and so peelin
Lust to touch everything
Still but no feelins
We move on through these stars
And when it's on it's on we movin strong
You know the rules, roll with fools
Who use two's no trainin
Hit your block, non-stop, no aimin
Black-Rainin, and man the forecast is bleek (yeah)
Stay inside, they said it's goin for weeks
It's war in the streets
Gangbangin and wearin east (say what)
Now the city that never sleeps will never see peace
I've had enough of still killin each other over nothin
Now there's more of us willin to die over colors
Man it's insane, black rain (insane)
Feedin our seeds, makin em strong with pain, the game
And yo we won't change (won't change)
Too blind to recognize, it's a damn shame (too blind to recognize)
Cause it's right in our eyes, Black Rain!
Chorus

I seen it all
When the black rain falls
Why will you fall
Black bodies fall
Black rain, you got time to explain
While I'm still strugglin, damn near insane
Damn hittin pain from years ago
Only you know, how the story goes
You took what I got left all in me
First you came, now the Lord's callin me
All in me, is what my Outlawz trained me
And all in me, is what my brothers gave me
And all you see is just another young thug
But please let my baby-boy play in the mud
Rain or sun, please let him have some fun
Don't wet the sidewalk, Daddy walks it to from
And don't let the pain that I touch he feel
And don't let him trust no snakes, that's real
Chorus

It's cold outside in the middle of the summer
Days fly by, night falls like lumber
Cries inside of the minds of the younger
The hunger scream through the city like thunder
It's like a bunch of black clouds we under
]From day one to day none my heart get no more
It's dark, tomorrow might come alone
Since I can't see clear, I stumbled home
It ain't fair, the air out here, too thin
I grieve and don't believe in the hearts of men
It's triflin', the life we in needs change
Till then, we hustlin, it's black rain

Yo, ain't no way out the hood
Can't stay out the hood
Hustle hard so every day out is good
The day seem dark, but the nights is bright
Ain't nobody goin down, so we likes to fight
Cops that come around tryin to cuff me up
Lock a brother down tryin to rough me up
We got a snitch on the block and he tellin the sergeant
Watchin like hawks, but I'm sellin regardless
My baby due soon I ain't playin with y'all
It happened so fast, first day and then gone
A million new things on coke this year
A million whole families went broke this year
We tryin to live long, can you tell me how?
I'm hopin that my heat don't fail me now
Every time I thinkin it's death, they tryin to tear me down
But see my in the flesh, can you stare me down
I do it for my fans, cause I'm livin for em
We seein clouds but I paint a perfect picture for em
Black rain, black rain
We seein clouds but I paint a perfect picture for em
Chorus
 (Young Noble) x repeated until end
Black Rain, don't come down (don't come)
Don't you come fallin
Black Rain, don't come down (don't come)
I don't want you fallin
 
 
 
(Chorus-Shaffar)
So many stories in the city I live in
I soak up the game, that everyone plays
I'm not the one so when they get caught sleepin
Out for the glory, there's so many stories around my way
(Verse 1-Napoleon)
It's been hard on us, day by day
Watchin my step gotta play where I lay
Now why this mother fucker wanna test me out
It's this thang I'ma protect myself and blow his brains out
Cold on the streets never talk on the phone
And the main thing is never bring a snake in your home
But that's hard black, why?
Cuz half the time them niggas be in your face
Smilin and shit but you don't know that
And I don't know why that nigga jealous of me
When he could do the same shit that pay me
In the streets breed a lot of killaz
That's why corners full of hate and the young ones is cap peelers
But they don't feel us when we're drownin in our own blood
And they don't know when we go home it's no love
So what's the use of us carin and shit
And that's the reason we buy guns, load 'em up and spit 'em at shit
(Chorus-Shaffar)
So many stories in the city I live in
I soak up the game, that everyone plays
I'm not the one so when they get caught sleepin
Out for the glory, there's so many stories around my way
(Verse 2)
(Young Noble)
I know niggas that was kings that turned into fiends
The nigga lost everything jewels and dreams
He losin teams, the murder rate higher than ever
Niggas need more than weed gettin higher than ever
Nuts in the streets my roots ain't nothin but deep
Niggas roam with the heat just for somethin to eat
Niggas sell to under covers then snitch on they brothers
Everybody sayin fuck us, I know God love us
(Mil a.k.a Hellraza)
I was raised when I cried in the household
Turned me into a nut
But these niggas didn't know
Just from bein home I seen enough before I learned the streets
I knew all about a gun 'cause my background was deep
A little dirty nigga holdin my pants when I run
It's a chance you gotta take everyday in the slums
This for the hoods where, certain people scared to come
I had a heart as a young nigga, now I don't fear none
(Chorus-Shaffar)
So many stories in the city I live in
I soak up the game, that everyone plays
I'm not the one so when they get caught sleepin
Out for the glory, there's so many stories around my way
(Verse 3-Kastro)
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
What more can I say it been that way a long time
And anybody, who think that rude
Can suck my dick until they spit my baby girl need food
I was young, when Pac put my hands on a gun
And told me life is what you make it
And stripes you gotta take them
It took a while for me to over stand
I was only 12 but I felt like a grown man
And livin on, and that which does not kill me can only make me strong
But ya'll niggas don't hear me though
My souljah story, for glorious pain
While I'm game you niggas playin, played out and lame
This shit hurt, my mind blind my dick in the dirt
And I'm so sick of bein tired, and tired of bein hurt
I search out the truth, and that shit worse
I swear it's a curse that the church can't nurse, come on
(Chorus-Shaffar)
So many stories in the city I live in
I soak up the game, that everyone plays
I'm not the one so when they get caught sleepin
Out for the glory, there's so many stories around my way
 
 
 
To the top, ha ha ha
Cause you know that's where we're going with this shit, right?
Question; what you think would happen?!
If you put the realest niggas down south, on a Mike Dean track
With the realest niggas from the West Coast!
You will have, the Trigger Happy motherfucking Geto Boys
Bringing the noise with the Outlawz
All competions is datable, cause our record is impeccable

Misery love company while these niggas wanna see me fall
My .44 Magnum make them crawl, fuck them all
I don't need them, they die like mutts
In the middle of the streets, with a slug in their guts
These niggas saying that I can't rap, now, look who bucked?
A bunch of broke ass niggas, who ain't got nothing
I'm motivated, to get the cheese
Rap shit played out, I'mma move to keys
As simple as that..

You better.. move something, if you want something
Paper chasing, motivation, gets my money coming
One in a million motherfuckers gonna make to where I made it
Broken and activated, I can see that you hate it
But hate on, and I'mma get my money right
Play on, all day long, you need to get your game tight
Later on, and I'mma get my money right
Play on, all day long, you need to get your game tight

I just might pull a trive stuff
That'll get my strike up, ride 'til I bite dust
For all you livers; tough talk must want
Put your beef on the street, put your feet on a creep
Keep your hand on your heat
A lot of big bros, snitch folks, holler out when they whistle
We'll run that, bring some of that, why you ?? so pitiful?
I know you call, play first, just in this role
Now, I don't call with no punk that have me no love
Where your hustle at? - ?? back and muscle right there
So when you rumble back, every one stacking for real
Leave my stacking to live, I'm just stacking some more
You niggas acting for real, ain't seen no drama before

Nigga, this shit definite, will retend your body
You got no Oxygen to resole with this breath of your life
I'll overcrossing it to the overdose
The youngest body see sneaks on the westcoast
There ain't no mummy strip us at divert coast
I'm comatosed, funny making
You got the Acting Up, I'll get the Jaw Breaking
I'm taking them, this shit is in my plate
You niggas taking it, it's real tonight
Some roll around the block, and got in the fist fight
It's me, moves as Napoleon, we're known to dress as real tight
Spotting the realest killers niggas when 'Pac got life
Nigga, I'm telling you, you better take your bat with your fate
This shit is a prevalent
And dead or alive, this shit is inherits
The Outlawz to the laws that's begging to live some more


Everyday, I hustle 'til I bubble, struggle 'til I juggle
So bitch you know, we don't love you
Fuck you!! - I don't trust you
The game ain't tight
And then, you're walking around acting like the game ain't right
Complain, all day about how you can't get paid
Winding instead of grinding all day
Man, that's the wrong way
Kingpin, on the good day
The scene's looking real lovely
To keep the nigga hardly looking buggie
For me, you'll get the shit
I don't owe you nothing
So miss with all that ethic paid story walking
The same shit happening often
You caught up slipping?
Now you're sleeping in the coffin, while I'm meeting at the office
Don't call that's my fault
That you're laying on the asphalt
Trying to take everything I'm busting my ass for
I know that's from my dreams, demon cutting the scene
I'm like a fiend, when it comes to this shit
Want anything, game tight, game tight
Outlaw all night, Outlawz, ugh
 
 
 
Outlaw, Outlaw
And we bring you the motherfucking Jersey Mob
In the name of Makaveli The Don and killa motherfuckin Kadafi

Everybody wanna know how I live my life (pucka)
Where's my balls? (pucka)
Where's my ice?
No matter now I answer they, feel my stripes
You keep poppin' shit, I'll pin my knights *dying*
At your bodega
Smokin' on your dro' Flavor
Spit some pimp shit
Then dip with your old neighbor (come on)
And if you really, feel some type of way about it
Run up in your hood, then I'll shoot my fuckin' way up out it
This Jersey Mob, Outlaw, Akwylah
To my crew selling coke clinkin' cock dollars
We in the same game, eat the pain, maintain
All the snitches wanna see us in chain gangs
To infiltrate us, that's all a cop thought of
We live stool pigeons soakin' in salt water *pigeon*
Only my lord and our crew know what happened to him
His family prayin 'cause one day they might back into him (uh-huh, uh-huh)

With nothin' to loose, I walk through clutchin' my tools
Ice-grill make you wanna say what's fuckin' with Smooth (yo, what's fuckin'
With that nigga?)
I'm sick of these crews, actin like they've been payin' dues
I put the heat to em, tell them niggas kick off they shoes
What would you do in the position when it's us against you?
That Teflon mother fucker, can your head take two?
Shut the fuck up 'fore your luck's up
What you gonna do when your shit's up
Besides get dissed on nigga, and pistol-whipped up
Tied up, mouth taped up, layed out, and hit up
Give you a break I give you a napkin to wipe that shit up
After the fact, most of the time, slit up or lit up
High drilly and shit yeah nigga you know the mix-up
We that squad for real, Jersey Mob for real
It be kill or be killed, so we drawin' that steel
I'm lovin' the rush, Essex county doublin' us, fuckin' with us (yeah, yeah
Yeah)
We ownin' enough, them rollers is bust

(Murder - repeated in background of chorus)
Murder made easy for dummies
Before you pull the trigger
Hit his pockets, take all his money
First you gotta be smart
Check his race and his bag
To see if he's strapped
And hit him once in the face
And that's that
Murder made easy for dummies
Before you pull the trigger
Hit his pockets, take all his money
First you gotta be smart
Check his race and his bag
To see if he's strapped
And hit him once in the face
And that's that

Well where you at then?
When I needed you the most
I hit rock bottom
I couldn't see that we was close
Yo box, watch em
Now they all Champaign
Ballin' campaign
Let a nigga fall in the rain
Dirty ya joints poppin' like you greasy burger enflamed
Every verse I drop's another small piece of the pain
Shit'll never be the same
Al Tariq got burned
Niggas is burnt out
And yo there's nowhere to turn
Like court adjourned
Without a quarter to burn
Short of return
To the same game in order to earn
Y'all niggas don't learn
I ain't concerned by far
Spit six bars like gem-star, stitches, and scars
Niggas dry snitchin', yo they intuition bizarre
Picture me starved
Without a pot to piss in, it's hard
Listen, my job's to find the right position tomorrow
Is mission imposs'?
I be yellin really my odds
Niggas kill me when they nod like they really alive

You ain't shit without your homeboys
Y'all ain't no grown boys
I feel it all in Nobe' voice
Now you stuck with no choice
Get on the ground, give up your property
It's like monopoly
With Jersey Mob beside me, ain't a mafucker stoppin' me
Squat, popped three in my throat
Wait for my shit to drop and this murder she wrote
Quim got the bolder close
And I got enough to go around for everybody challengin'
Guns, never silence, I'm still wildin like Allen
And Mister Jeru, well it's mob. all that deep shit
You can keep it
Fuck frontin, I never kept a secret
My dog Swift, doin a hard shift in the jail
I'm still sendin' him mail
We livin' in Hell
My mom dukes told me 'life is what you make it'
So watch yours close
And The Outlawz will fuck around and take it
I got these fiends payin a hundred a gram, fifty for half
I'll get em for thirty that's why I dump at last

(Murder - repeated in background of chorus)
Murder made easy for dummies
Before you pull the trigger
Hit his pockets, take all his money
First you gotta be smart
Check his race and his bag
To see if he's strapped
And hit him once in the face
And that's that

We catch niggas at the stop light
And do what's not right
Hold grudges for centuries
To the O.G.'s send peace kites
We seek night, then we run through your rest
Got a bitch with your name on her breast
Up to set up your death
We watch your ass for ten months
If we gots to (yeah)
Then the first mistake you make (see them)
Mother fucker we gots you (got em)
We do it so cold
We make your niggas think they saw a ghost
You untouchable niggas don't even know we so close
(right next to you nigga)
Coast to coast, we spread so rapidly
Man, the niggas sittin next to you answer to me
Cause we can touch you when we want to
So watch your tongue
We listenin closely man
Y'all know how we run
We got guns
Plus the ones that Pac left (uh-huh)
We got enemies
Plus the ones that Pac left (uh-huh)
We bang thug life, outlaw
Cause that's our job (yeah, yeah)
We backed by the Mob
And we hittin' these niggas hard
So what?

(Murder - repeated in background of chorus)
Murder made easy for dummies
Before you pull the trigger
Hit his pockets, take all his money
First you gotta be smart
Check his race and his bag
To see if he's strapped
And hit him once in the face
And that's that
 
 
 
Life is what you make it nigga
Get up off your ass and get some
Always hollering about you want something nigga
Verse 1: Young Noble
Yo, I've been abducted by the block
But I had to escape
Imagine my fate
Traveling and stacking the cake
After my wake
Bust 25 for me
Cause I'll ride for y'all
And y'all ride for me
I ain't trying to have no sad story in the end
Me and my people all we want is glory in the end
I ain't gonna tell you again

Gonna be Hell 4 a Hustla
Till the gats find me
And you can ask 1-2
He used to be on new
And you can ask swift gotti
Don't shit get by me

And you can ask L Dog if I ever felt y'all

Splitting your wig
Making that bitch a split decision
Thug living although my mama taught me much better
I was addicted to the streets

And better than my heart

The goal is to get dough
And stay cold
Keep tripping'

Tryin' hard just to make it in this thing called life
I know it get tough, but everything alright
I give it up to god and I smoke my weed
Eyes Chinese, stay focused on the cheese
Eyes on the prize, like the dream of the king
Eyes on the grind cause I gotta get meat
Get it poppin, get it now, if you can don't wait
Get your mind right, live in the essence, what it take?
You can shine bright with words, in your hand
Don't be scared to fly
Don't be scared to feel
Don't be scared to die
This ain't meant to be no justice, you ain't got to live a lie
Cause' it is what it is, if you can see through God's eyes
I be mad at the world cause there's too much hate
Show and live it in love for my brothers upstate
We all lost hope and tryin' hard to make amends
Wash away all the pains and forgive all the sins

Wash away
All this pain we're feelin' everyday
Wanna see a brighter day
So ashamed..
So much wrong we're doing everyday
Only you can wash away..

Drivin through the city in the middle of the night
I can feel it in the air, pray to god I do it right
I'm a hustler on the grind, everyday another fight
Everybody tryin' tell me how to live my life
Play the hand I was dealt, I can do it by myself
Long as I got you, I'm good, I don't need no help
I do it all if I gotta, all you gotta do is call
Just look over my family, But family should call
All we got is us, in thugs I trust
In the future that may fall, then your gun I bust
You ain't got to worry, I'm a ride to the end
My one and only family, my brothers like kin
We treat em like friends, from buckets to the Benz
From niggas dead broke, to Stack' your motherfuckin ends
We all lost hope, and tryin' hard to make amends
Wash away the pain, and forgive all the sins

(Verse 3: Young Noble)
Wash away the pain, wash away my sins and rain
Never forget, just forgive the game
The way we livin' is strange, stuck in our ways, ain't nobody willing to change, duckin them strays or stuffed in a cage
The block is a maze so we called it a trap
Hip hop is dead, mission to resuscitate rap
I don't write lyrics, I just jot how I'm feelin
It's therapeutic, it's thug music that we give em
And it's straight from the soul, this thug life is sacred that's why we play it by the ancient codes
It's an everyday struggle tryin' to stay above water, shit I do this for my son, I do this for my daughter
Tellin' my lil nigga I love him, I know this life is a test
Less praying when you struggling, more praying when you blessed
Faithful and grateful for all of that I achieve
Raise my seeds to grow...I can die in peaceRGF productions

And you can be Gabrielle and I’ll be Dwyane Wade
I know you very well and we want the same thing
But, life ain’t a fairytale; my niggas gangbang
Just to be honest, I think she in college
If life was a VCR, I would rewind it
Take off your Vicky bra and let me inside it
I might get excited if I get invited
But, baby don’t fight it
Cause this is celebration every time we united
Just show me how you feel
Cause you ain’t gotta hide it
And you can take the wheel
If you know how to ride it, if you know how to ride it

Used to stay in the trap house, was serving fiends their breakfast
All I do is count money, my lil brother stretch it
Don’t get shit on my hands now, my shit’s too fucking special
Big ZooWap from the bando, I’m sending you a message
Everything that I land on, I swear to God I smash it
And my whole damn camp on, I heat it up and pass it
Every beat that I Wap on, I put it in a casket
Hit the gas on my spaceship, I hate waiting in traffic
Like they all at a standstill, watch ZooWap fucking pass ‘em
Khaos pull out that forty, he doing too much yapping
I am GMOB, we folk can get it cracking
How you stand on your block without your pistol, boy you lacking
Pillow talk to them bitches bout me, boy I find out faster

Riding in the drop top with a mami
Hundred bands I’ma drop soon on my time piece
Tints all on my beamer boy, ZooWap I’m so special
Came up off of nothing, now it’s money in my dresser
Only jeans I rock got wings, five hundred just to dress up
Stupid loud in the woods, ZooWap roll it faster
Had to check my fucking six, I floor it, it go faster
ZooWap from the trap, I swear my sack is a disaster
Different color twelve, twelve skinnies in a plastic
You gon' need a fucking phantom if you tryna match it
Gritt and Dice on twenty-eight, trapping out the mansion
Old school days, Box Chevy for my grandma
All I wanna do is whip, put ZooWap on the landmark
Thru these streets I’m movin' quick like big ZooWap a landshark
Talking shit, can’t leave your block
That’s how you get your land marked
Heavy cheese, my neck gon' freeze and Gucci Mane my role model
Every time I hit the club, we pop at least ‘bout four bottles
Every time we leave the club, you see all the hoes follow
If that nigga acting crazy, he gon' get the whole hollow
ZooWap, I don’t give a fuck, got sympathy for nobody
All they gotta do is cut the check, I go get four Robins
ZooWap I’m the motherfucking best, compared to nobody

Chop that ass down, chop chop that ass down

Whistling Dixie
Middle school, I was getting head on a ten speed
Gigolo blood line, pimpin' hereditary
Black on 28's, it remind of February
Day you can fuck with me, that would be Neveruary
Dead ass rapper should have came with a cemetery
I am so cold, nigga like Ben & Jerry
Fill a nigga, deal a nigga, kill a nigga, obituary
My vision blurry, these bitches flirtin'
I've been drinking all night, I think my kidney's hurtin'
So I closed the curtains on the 62
Her ass would knock your ass out, you better stick and move
Chain hang to my ding-a-ling
Chain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling
To do a threesome you gotta intervene
Her legs so sexy when I'm in-between

Hey, look at baby over there
Wassup, little mama come here
She started talking but I really couldn't hear
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror
Like she do it in the mirror, like she do it in the mirror
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Like she do it in the mirror

She do it like she do it in the mirror
Be cautious, that booty is bigger than it appears
She speed it up or slow it down, like she's switching gears
I'm looking for the baddest one here
I tell her like, do that there, do that there
You gotta stretch it out, girl move that there
She bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there
Like hut one, hut two, girl who back there?
Who back there? I'm back there
I could take a step back and sip my cognac there
Picture perfect body, that's a Kodak there
Now make a nigga feel welcome like a doormat's there

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

I could really use a wish right now
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shooting stars
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
A wish, a wish right now

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

Dreaming… of falling
Dreaming… of falling

Yeah, let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eatin' lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Tryin' to be the next rapper comin' out the A (A-Town)
Hopin' for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane
Okay, and everybody know my name (Bob)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Sellin' out arenas with big-ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

Okay, let's pretend like this never happened (never)
Like I never had dreams of bein' a rapper (rapper)
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes
 (classes)
Like I never used to run away into the blackness
 (yeah)
Now, let's pretend like it was all good (good)
Like I didn't live starin' in the notebook (notebook)
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should (should)
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood
 (hood)
Yeah, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name (no)
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a. Bobby Ray
I'm talkin' back before the mixtapes 
Before the videos
 
and the deals and the fame (yeah)
Before they ever once compared me to André (3 stacks)
Before I ever got on MySpace (yeah)
Before they ever noticed my face (yeah)
So let's just pretend and make wishes outta airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone
They're just memories
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone
All right…

Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things woulda been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
"Marshall, you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win."
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
"Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch!"
"You won't amount to shit—quit daydreamin', kid!"
"You need to get your cranium checked."
"You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic."
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it
To the Rap Olympics, slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
‘Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap, so he ain't even here, he pretends that—

Airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
 
 
 
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

I'm out of my fucking mind, gee, gee, golly, oh my
I was doing fine, once upon a time
Then my brain left and it didn't say bye
Don't look at me wrong, I'm out of my mind
Like Nostradamus and da Vinci combined
So paranoid of espionage
I'm watching my doors and checking my blinds
My brain is on vacation, they telling me
And I'm bi-polar to the severity
And I need medication, apparently
And some Electroconvulsive therapy
I am a rebel, but yes, I'm so militant
Still I'm illegible for disabilities
I am psychotic but there is no remedy
This is not figurative, this is literally
If these niggas go dumb, I go to the mental facility
See, man I'm so out there, I slap fives with ET
I don't need a feature
They don't want me to eat à la carte when I'm on this beat
If you feel the same as me, then you got to agree
I'm out of my mind

I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

What's your name? B.o.B?
So, they calling you Bob?
Stop playing, nigga, you know that I'm known for the 'Bob
Couple hit songs, got you thinking you a hearthrob
Well, this thang so good, make a nigga wanna sob (Hmm, hmm)
You don't need a feature?
Nigga, I'm the feature
You gon' be the priest, and I'mma be the preacher
You can be the He-Man, I'mma be the She-Ra
You can be the Grim, I'mma be the Reaper
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night skies
Are like shooting stars?
Well, you gon' really need a wish right now
When my goons come through and start shooting stars
You know, I'm all about shoes and cars
I'm kinda drunk off booze, Bacardi
I told Baby when I get my new advance
I'mma blow that motherfucker on a blue Bugatti
You know, I graduated summa cum laude
That's why they thinking I'm Illuminati
And matter fact, let's kiss and make-up
I'll help you escape on my blue Ducati
Hallelujah!

I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

I'm out of it
I can't seem to come out of it
What's going on inside of my head?
It feels like I'm being John Malkovich
Ladies and gentlemen, please tone it down a bit
There is an announcement, I like to announce (It...)
Wait, how am I suppose to pronounce this shit?

I don't need a sub, I don't need a speaker
Cause a nigga bring the noise like an onomatopoeia
Leave him in the dust, all he see is my Adidas
Na na na na boo boo, wouldn't want to be ya
Never turning back, how you think I got here?
And I'm never slowing down, fuck was that a deer?
If you got a problem, step to the office
Matter fact, never mind, talk to the Kiosk, bi-atch
You have no idea
That's why they call me B dot; been a maniac ever since I was knee-high
Man, I swear to God, I'mma need help
Someone call Charter
; maybe call FEMA
Cause I got to be crazy or outta my mind to have this many stamps on my VISA, vis-à-vis

I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

Wait, if I'm here and you're there?
And I'm here and you're there? 
(If I'm there and you're here?)
And I'm here and you're there?
(If I'm there and you're here?)
And if I'm here and you're there?
(If I'm there and you're here?)
And if I'm here and you're there?

Yeah, you're right there, and here
Um, yeah, yeah (We're outta here)
Nicki, B.o.B, ho
(Shh... they might be listening)
 
 
 

Beautiful girls

I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
(Go, go, go, go)

Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style they ain't really got nothin' on
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it

I've been to London (Yeah), I've been to Paris (Yeah)
Even way out there to Tokyo (Tokyo)
Back home down in Georgia (Yeah) to New Orleans (Yeah)
But you always steal the show (Steal the show)
And just like that, girl, you got me froze (Got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew, well now you know
(Know, know, know, know)

Or a car or a train
No other girl's in my brain
And you the one to blame

Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time

See, see, when I rhyme I flow on the beat like pitta-da-da
See I deceive ya with my intergalactic ether (yeah)
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave ya with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel (yeah!)
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you sayin', it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
[Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (yes it turns to gold)

you would swear I was an equestrian
And um, I'ma hit her with that pipe, call that Nancy Kerrigan
Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians
You be on that minor league, but we smoke professionally
I do my job exceptionally
, 
on point like a decimal is
The way I ride on the beat man
I beat every street, it's done so effortlessly
Yeah, so these niggas can't sleep on me, there's no 
Inception
 in this
Bitch, I'm top chef, you Top Ramen, I'm top shelf
No last call, to the bartender; "what you got left?"
Pour it up, don't stop there, hold your cup, take a shot, yeah
All night we celebrate, cause we everywhere and you not there

All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)

Uh, blue jeans, I'm faded,
 
mining my own data
Smokin' on that strong, that Arnold Schwarzenegger
It’s Tunechi Li, you bitch you
You hot as a igloo
Kick back on that Glock, call that Jiu Jitsu
Hello world, I’m with a yellow girl, number two pencil
These rappers is washed up, spin cycle, rinse you
My nigga, all day, all night, half-pipe
I dive in that pussy, ya I belly flop, I jack knife
And shit, tell my homies that I say it’s a party
Yeah, got that TEC for technical difficulties
I’m top dog, you top ramen, I’m top dog
Piru, gangsters, outlaws!

All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out 
(That's all we do, that's all we do) 
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out 
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)

Well ain't no question, yes, it's B.o.B, yes definitely
Up in the studio, I got all my necessities
Look, if you want that real shit, you made the right selection
I'm Decatur 'til I die, yes I rep that definitely
They say I'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I say it's a curse, but it's been mostly a blessin'
To a nigga from the hood
Tryin' to aim for the top, I didn't even need no directions
I just wake up then I roll up the purp
But these niggas wake up on my dick, at least have some breakfast first
Nigga keep your nourishment first, and your mind on my lyrics
Cause what you hopin' to accomplish, I already did it
Bitch!

All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)

And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)
 
 
 
As the war between light and darkness continues
Heroes and villains become harder to identify
Kindred spirits separated at birth
Fighting for their place in time to be solidified
The clock ticks faster and faster
While time runs a marathon in this Babylon
But see, the end is only the beginning
The beginning of the calm before the storm

I used to dream of success, now success is inadequate
It seems the bigger I get it's the more they get mad at me
Cause there ain't no rules inside this fight that we battling
And it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it
And I swear it's like a fucked up reality
But creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate
I guess, and I ain't too big on duality but
You think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me
So fly: no gravity, so high: Mount Everest
And the show must go on, yes, but I don't have to act in it
And they don't make a television that handles the frequencies
Of my channel and there ain't no computer that can hack it
It just don't have the capacity, hell nah, that ain't happening
You hustle? Well we are Grand Hustle, nigga, we mastered it
Y'all working on your bachelors, we ball like the athletes
Drink wine out of chalices on Sunday like we catholics
And if this is an embassy, consider me ambassador
Official, no artificial preservatives or additives
I love it all but I ain't attached to it
They call this a game because it is exactly

Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)

And it seems like in the grand scheme of it all
The world's run by a few people and we never seen them at all
How do they exist if we don't know who they are?
They can be you, they could be me, they could be queens and gods
Some say that we're slaves, an alien race created us all
From a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve
But if anything, what you finna see is a change, don't be alarmed
And whoever they are, well I think that it's time we start takin' charge
Fuck rules, fuck bars, you can be whatever you want
You could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold
And in the springs, on the falls, you could never see it all
If you don't know what I mean, have you seen Niagara Falls?
Man I swear this world is ours, but I've just been pushed too far
Now I be beasting up on these bars
Freak out a beat and then beat it out raw
Good God, if I go this hard, by the time I'm ninety
I won't need viagra nah, even if I had a dog
I be the canine, I'd have a ball
Better watch out when you cross my yard
I am a flame, I am the spark
I am in drive, y'all are in park
Look at my shot, look at the arc
Look at the crowd as soon as I start
Look in they eyes and look in they hearts
Two middle fingers straight at the law
Sincerely yours, so pray to your lord
Cause this is a war, ain't talkin' 'bout bullets and swords
UFOs don't make any noise
When they travel in hyper speed, so welcome aboard

Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)

As the mask of deception falls off the face of humanity
Unveiling the grim reality of duality
In which everyone is a casualty, no one will be exempt
Truth has many shades
It's not a matter of black and white, but gray
Although many, we are one, so in the final analysis
Could it be that we are fighting a war that can't be won?
 
 
 
Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la

Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good

Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
 
 
 
Yeah, you ain't seen my best
Checkmate, ain't a game of chess
Globalists see me as a threat
Free thinking, got a world at my neck
Hah, am I paranoid? Picture Malcolm X
In a room full of pigs, trying not to bust a sweat
Aye, Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest
They probably write that man one hell of a check
Aye, I'm over here on this side of town
Come on over, over, over, over here, try to clown
Aye, I never pipe down
If they weren't coming for me then
They definitely coming for me now
I can't even keep my phone charged up
All this shit I'm talking, I should get my home barred up
Rappers get off of my dick and get your own bars up
Now the mirror lizard's breath got the clones scared cuz
Woo, use your, use your common sense
Why is NASA part of the department of defense?
They divided up the seas into thirty-three degrees
Feeding kids masonry, bruh, be careful what you read

Flat line, flat line
There's no superior blood line
Flat line, flat line
You got me once but that died, aye

Voice, voice, do I have a voice?
Do I give a fuck? Do I have a choice?
Joint, joint, I roll up a joint
Keep my shooters in the game like I hate to disappoint
I see only good things on the horizon
That's probably why the horizon is always rising
Indoctrinated in a cult called science
And graduated to a club full of liars
Heliocentrism, you were the sixth victim
Fuck you and your team, you can sit on the bench with 'em
They nervous, but before you try to curve it
Do your research on David Irving
Stalin was way worse than Hitler
That's why the POTUS gotta wear a kippah
I'm a man first 'fore an artist
Get a lawyer, look up Doctor Richard Sauder

Flat line
You fooled us for the last time
Flat line, flat line
There's no superior blood line

So you want to find the farthest point from that center. And it turns out sea level at the equator is farther away from the center of the Earth than sea level near the poles. It has nothing to do with global warming and melting of the ice caps
(Why is that?)
Because... Earth, we know it spins, once a.... day. Yes, thank you. Three people know that, how long a day lasts here
(Good for row number two, they're off to a great start)
So you, so you spin, you know when you spin pizza dough, it kind of flattens out. It gets wider in the middle and...so Earth, throughout its life, even when it formed, it was spinning, and it got a little wider at the equator than it does at the poles. So it's not actually a sphere, it's an...it's oblate, it's officially an oblate spheroid. That's what we call it. But not only that, it's slightly wider below the equator than above the equator
(A little chubbier?)
Little chubbier, chubby's a good word, it's like pear-shaped. So it turns out the pear-shapedness is bigger than the height of Mount Everest above sea level

Flat line
You fooled us for the last time
Flat line, flat line
There's no superior blood line
Dead
 
 
 
Seems like your heart stops workin'
The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're
Taking a smoke break, you
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doin'
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just 'cause you got somewhere to go, so
You take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've
Got a prescription, you
Got an addiction
Who do you think that you're foolin'?

John Doe
I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Ah
Errybody's addicted to somethin'
Errybody got a grip onto somethin'
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or somethin' to find
You struggle in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
The people that you work with notice the signs
When you walk in the room it gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence
You say you've been at the gym
But the way that you look, can't blame on the diet
So what you hidin'?

John Doe
I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Yeah
I probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...
I mean, had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up with me 'cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her "Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slipped and fell, clumsy me!"
Well at least I admit it
'Cause the worst you could do is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it
Well I ain't no different, I love all the money, the fame and the parties with beautiful women
I spent so much time as a underground artist
 'cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge you become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot and change your perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dyin' and wishin' to live and experience everything possible
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical, now I can see it, it's optical

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
John Doe
I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home

Forbes list

She from Atlanta but she on that Cali strain
That's that overseas money, call 'em Taliban(ds)
She WMD, all year spring to winter
So pencil her in for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner

She want them bands like a freelance parade (All day)
Compliments of Bobby Ray

And my team's going green and I ain't talking 'bout pottery
You tryin' to hit the party, she tryin' to hit the lottery
And if they watchin' girl, you're grandfather clockin' it

Violent bravado, call me Bobby Bravo

So why don't you let go, let go
You're losing control
The music got you movin' and you're losing your mind

She wanna pop bottles and chill with all the folk
Hang with all the models and all the centerfolds
Showin' off her body, now watch her strike a pose
Tryin' to get beside me so she can get a hold
Of them ole Bobby Ray Bands
She want them Ray Bands, she want them Ray Bands
Bobby Ray Bands
She want them Ray Bands, she want them Ray Bands
She want them Ray Bands, Bobby Ray Bands
 
 
 
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

Uhh
Ever thought about losing it
When your money’s all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times
But you still can’t find no food in it
That’s foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is a uphill battle
But y’all tryna climb with the same ol’ ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
Why so shallow? I’m just askin'
What’s the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ain’t a number one draft pick
Most of us ain’t Hollywood actors
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

I could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That’s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
For all the times no one’s ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep
And you feel like you’re just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that’ve molded us
And if life hadn’t chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y’all

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
 
 
 
You will be mine
Even if you're somebody else's
But not for long
Girl, not for long
'Cause I'm your type
If you've got the wrong impression
Girl, not for long
Girl, not for long

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow
Maybe at the club, maybe at the bar
I wanna show you off like a trophy car, whip it
'Cause anything is better than nothing at all
Nothing at all, nothing on you
I just wanna show you a table for two
All you did was go on a date with a dude
You know he don't fit, he ain't tailored for you
You just on a nigga dick 'cause he sold a brick
Has he ever wrote a hit on some poet shit?
That's who you chillin' on the sofa with?
I ain't trippin', in a minute it'll be over with, ay

You will be mine (Be mine)
Even if you're somebody else's
But not for long
Girl, not for long

Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
But not for long
Girl, not for long
Girl, not for long
Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
But not for long
Girl, not for long
Girl, not for long

When they see us together, hell naw they can't stand it
I wonder if you're matchin' you bras with them panties
A gorgeous skin tan, hit the mall to do damage
The way she hit the high notes, we all gon' have Grammys
It's marble not granite
Tiptoein' from the counter, to the shower, for a hour
Super powers, super powers
That's that mojo, Austin Powers
Search "real nigga", I'ma pop up in your browser
Ae, so go and get your body wet
Panties off, we ain't made it to the lobby yet
Put you on game girl, so it's obvious
I'll give you the world if you ain't got it yet, Bobby

You will be mine (Be mine)
Even if you're somebody else's
But not for long
Girl, not for long
'Cause I'm your type (Girl)
If you've got the wrong impression
Girl, not for long
Girl, not for long

Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
But not for long
Girl, not for long

You might be, with someone else
But I still see that you finna be with a G like me
You'll never need, no one else
And I know you know, I'ma be like, "I told you so"

You will be mine (Be mine, girl)
Even if you're somebody else's (Even if you're somebody else's)
But not for long (Oh, girl)
Girl, not for long (Girl)
'Cause I'm your type (Girl)
If you've got the wrong impression

Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Girl, not for long (Not for long)
Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Girl, not for long
Girl, not for long
 
 
 
Apply major pressure my nigga
You hear me?

Money on my mind, can't take it off that shit
A nigga's got five different iPhones
I only pick it up for that grip
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready

It's Ray Bands and Freebandz
, we getting money
While you're hating, we're somewhere in Abu Dhabi
With Arabians G5'in, and with my posse
It's outrages, on that good Jamaican
That's right I'm too faded, you're two shaded
I'm too greedy with two ladies
Excellence I'm exuberating
I'm finna smash like two potatoes
I don't give a fuck, not even two maybes
I turn up on niggas like rutabagas
I do it daily, I do it daily
That's my swag, you should pay me
Ain't that the truth?
This is my whip, ain't that the coupe?
Hustle Gang ain't that the squad?
Bitch, act like you've got a clue
While they out here catching feelings, I'mma catch a flight or two
I just give her major pressure while she gave me major (ooooh!)

Money on my mind, can't take it off that shit
They've got five different iPhone's
Always picking up for that grip
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready

Anything they wanna do, hell yeah I'm ready for it
Sexy bitch, just throw that back, hell yeah she's ready for it
They thought that the boy was stool, now my shit, they're checkin' for it
And your girl, she's addicted to it, I think that ho needs Betty Ford
All I heard was "that boy's pop"
All I heard was "that boy's not"
Top 5 on any list, but I've moved up by five slots
I'm passed one, high as fuck
I don't see niggas until I look down
I've just turned my crib in to the hookah spot
You are now welcomed to the kush lounge
So miss me with that fuckery
Girl, come here with that suckery
Ham Squad, Hustle Gang,
 
that's that Underground Luxury
I don't mess with them fake types, I'd ban hem all, if it was up to me
Even if a bitch was a cashier, still she'd never get a buck from me

Money on my mind, can't get off that shit
They've got five different iPhones
Always picking up for that grip
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
 
 
 
How much must I repeat? We only play for keeps
No time-outs, no free throws, no refs, no penalties
No handouts, no pit stops, no cheat codes, no sleep
But the drinks are on us, if you with it then pull up a seat

When you’re roaming through the jungle talk is nothing, talk is cheap
Time is money, money is power, power corrupts eventually, damn
So what are the options? What are the choices left for me?
What other rule is left to break? I guess my fate is a quest for me
Man I’m a dog that ain’t got no leash
Man got a crib, it ain’t got no lease
Man got a flow that ain't got no brain
But I still get brain, no hands no teeth, uh
Nowadays, niggas are killas on the beat
But where I was raised all of the killas was down the street
Better do your research
Feeling like I fell out of the sky and landed feet first
My squad go hard, my squad go concrete, watch my team work
Hell yea, you can tell that the boy finna eat cause I took my seat first
3 course meal, full entrée, refills and I want my dessert
So why not make a toast? Tomorrow could always be worse
Now keep them bottles coming by the kiloliter
And get that Ana off your chest, try to keep a clean shirt
I’m so Grand Hustle, you ain’t even in my league sir
What’s up with these nerds?
They be out here, gettin’ their salads tossed, gettin’ their leaves turned
The game just ain’t what it used to be, the quality is blurred
But a dying breed survives and a dynasty emerged
So put it in the air if you entirely concur
She call me hippie cause I live without any concern
Up on this green earth, I’m on them green herbs
Yeah yeah, yeah, I stay in them trees like the Keeblers
And they say that I look higher in person
As a kid I played in the yard, but now I’m astro turfing
I lived the actual version of the fantasies they utter
Made up stories of threesomes, they must just be seeing double
Run for cover, here comes trouble
My heart is going cold so I gotta sleep with warmer covers
Polar bear pimpin’, solar flare spittin’
Somebody tell ‘em that this is professional stuntin’, don’t attempt it
Society is twisted, they tryna take us under
So when you see them folks, don’t forget to warn a brother
I made it out alive but still the battle is a struggle
Veni, vidi, vici, I came, I saw, I conquered
They mad cause I murdered the game
And their name wasn’t in the will
You see, most of these haters are mad rappers who just still waiting on a deal
And they jealous of my success cause my shoes cost more than a bill
But I’ll never sit down at another table unless I’m invited to the meal
To some it’s like conquering mountains, to me it’s like stepping on hills
Remember the images in your mirror can be bigger than they appear
And the truth can be hard to swallow, depends on the size of the pill
And by the looks it’s about the time that you had your prescription filled
My life, full length feature presentation
There are no intermissions, no time for commercial breaking
A fighter in his prime, a legend in the making
There’s no debating when you let your numbers make the statement

Now open your mind up and listen you niggas
I am the master, the guru and after I school you I'm skinning you niggas
You finished, I'm making chinchillas out niggas
You should be embarrassed some banging pop rapper is killing you niggas
Consider this tax for the swag that my city has given you niggas
And I know I'm the man, no, I don't need no Grammy award on my mantle
Know it don't matter, the beat it don't matter, the style, any flow I can channel
You see I'm from Atlanta, east side of Decatur, I grew up on Candler
If you notice the way that I talk is vernacular, this is my actual grammar
I got these niggas nervous cause whatever lane that I'm in I'mma handle
Your lyrics are wack and emotionally shallow
You lost in my thoughts, you don't know how to paddle
I know that I'm shining, I know that I'm shining
Don't worry cause you can find shade in my shadow
From my point of view there's so many dead rappers
Shit, all we need is a memorial banner
My first mixtape, they all said I sounded like Dre
Then they said my album was pop, didn't really sound like the mixtape
Now I'm doing what I started, now they telling me I changed
I hear underrated so much you would swear it was my name
Ain't no rappers on my list
Come holla at me when you're done riding each others dick
25 million singles worlwide, I'll guess I'll take another hit
Matter of fact I find this rap shit boring, man I'm over it
Give me my guitar pick, I'll show you shit
 
 
 
Mmm, hey, I eat it like dinner
You see this shit I gotta deal with from these beginners?
I ain't circusin' around with these clown-ass niggas
You snappin' at the heels of a world class sprinter
Some may call this bullyin', some may call this bossin'
Check the letter, man, you know I'm All City varsity
Walk up on my field, you will get carried off it
We gon' need a body bag and we gon' need a coffin
Who am I battling? I ain't even exhausted
You can call me sick, you can even call me nauseous
A sea of great whites, you are a dolphin
If I was you, I would be a little more cautious
I'm way too high for you to look at
The future ain't lookin' promising for these rookies
This is target practice but I don't even pull the fucking trigger anymore
Cause it's just a waste of bullets
Come and get these pussies, wipe them off the flo'
I'm guessing they was hoping for some different results
I'm guessing they was guessing cause they wasn't really sure
But fuck it, I guess I'mma have to let these niggas know
So I think it's time for these haters to get off my dick
Got my own city, you can call it Bobtropolis
East side representers reppin' with authority
And I ain't talking congressmen and I ain't talking politics
Lookin' for freaks, freaks lookin' for sausages
But we already know that, so that is all to get
Check the name tag, you know who the roster is
ATL brand, Hustle H.A.M squad in this bitch
Like I ain't never had a mic
Fresh to death, I see you in the afterlife
I eat bars, eat beats for my appetite
You wouldn't know about that, you never had a bite
What I gotta do to get some solidarity?
Apparently, I need to speak with some more clarity
No luck needed, know no charity
And I'mma grown man, don't need pussy to take care of me
B to the O, I said it once befo'
If I ain't on your channel, go and look for the remote
Already graduated, yeah, you see the cap and robe
But now you couldn't see me 'less you had a telescope
I'm Bedrock bumpin', three strikes sumpin
Call me Jack-o-Lantern, I get head like pumpkins
It's nothin', roll up the stuffin'
Put it in the oven, get baked like muffins
If you ain't know, I guess I have to introduce ya
To my side of town, somethin' you ain't really used to
Body blow, uppercut, I do more than bruise ya
Keep fuckin' with me and you ain't gon' have no future
 
 
 
If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now (Right now)
And say damn, I'm killing them (Damn), damn, I'm killing them (Damn)
I know they feeling me now

And I'm still here with a lifestyle you would kill fo' (Brap!)
Still here with the same shoes that I had on from the get-go (Yeah)
Straight out of Atlanta, Georgia, for any of y'all that didn't know (East Side)
And I'm never that hard to find because 420 is my zip code (Haha, yeah)
But back then couldn't get dro (Nah) 'cause back then I was this broke (Yeah)
That's why I got so many hustles (Uh), bruh man from the fifth floor (Nah)
What would you do in the middle of the winter
When the sun goes down and it gets cold?
Growin' up in a house with no stove
No doors, no walls, no windows
And my brother was always fresher
I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go
So that's why now this the type of life that I live for
Comin' up as a youngin', man, some nights I would vomit
I would throw up on myself 'cause I was so sick to my stomach
Now I'm the shit, fix the plumbin'
Bare with me y'all, I'm this close (This close)
Spent my whole life chasin' chips, where's Nabisco? (Where's Nabisco?)
My past memories, I miss those (Miss those)
Hey, all I can say is you get what you wish for

If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them (Let's get it, let's go)
I know they feeling me now (Ayy)

I'm fresh off my pit-stop, flow airtight with no Ziploc (Bah!)
Get shit pop when my shit drop (Bah!), no hip-hop, this Tip hop (Yeah)
I'm back standin' at the tip top where I belong, it won't be long
'Til you hear me on a B.o.B song (Ahh), some chick gettin' my skeet on (Skeet)
To touch the sole of my feet, G, you gon' have to get your reach on (Ah)
I'm up all the way high, all the way fly, on the ground, I'm off the radar
Bernie Madoff money, dawg, got killers paid off with it all
I got the juice (Hello), could you place a call and we place a call to who place a call (Go)
Don't get your part and not too hard, I disregard what you say (Yeah)
Back up the truck and pass the buck, here's where it's stoppin' today
Got swag all on me, homie, can't wipe it away, we too ill, ill
That's how we got arenas, domes and stadiums filled
Ayy, how you feel?

If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now (Damn right)
And if you too fresh in the building (In the building)
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now (High, high, high, high)
And say damn, I'm killing them (Damn), damn, I'm killing them (Damn)
I know they feeling me now (Yeah)

And I'm still here in a black whip full of Strange Clouds (Full of Strange Clouds)
And I'm still here with the same team, nigga, stay down
Still here for the East Side, ain't a thang change but the bank 'count (East Side, ha!)
Hands high when I come 'round 'cause I'm killin' this shit nigga, hands down (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
And I go hard, my passport's like a postcard (Ha)
Give a fuck if I'm solo, I'll go toe-to-toe with your whole squad (Yes)
With the soul of a soldier but even still, I don't want no parts
And no niggas with no hearts, you cocksuckers need throat guards
I'm throwed off for the most part, a young dog with an old bark (Woof)
Flow dumb, but I'm so smart, I compose art, call me Mozart
My nightlife's like a soap opera with two chicks like it's Noah's ark
They got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like, "Oh God" (Oh God)
From a poor child to on top like a mohawk (Ha)
But I always knew I'd go far like a gas truck with no park (No park)
So no applause (No applause), hold the applause
Just put your hand up if you know the song

If anybody feeling fresh in the building (In the building)
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
 
 
 
Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

'Cause I'm glidin' up there, oh so very high that if the
Clouds were to drop me then I'd, fall out the sky, I don't really
Know why I'm here, I guess I'm, just here for the ride, I swear it
Feels like I'm dreamin', it's vividly defined, yeah
So call me whatever you want, title me whatever you like
But let's get one thing straight, you know my name
So I run this town, when I'm on this mic, yeah
So here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray, I don't know, need I know
But I know, that I flow, rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes
Then I go, as my story goes
I know I've done been down here before
Product of my East Decatur home
'Cause I was in the cold, tryna keep my toes unfroze
Now I'm in your house, now I'm in your soul
Now I'm everywhere that your iPod go
Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago

Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

Yeah, well I'm from much lower than where that pavement is
'Cause there ain't no parachute that they can make for this
'Cause I put my pain, my heart, my soul, my faith in this
Does anyone feel like how I feel? Then you can relate to this
Or just blaze to this, maybe roll one up, then take a hit
Toast to the good life then take a sip
Vacay everyday, yeah take a trip
It's easy to see I was made for this
From the womb all the way to the grave I spit
Just to show y'all niggas what greatness is, yeah
I'm talkin' very lucid, like makin' movies
To picture my life boy, you need a higher resolution
I used to cut class in the day, then run away at night
But now I'm ruler of the upper class and I don't even write

Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
 
 
 
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

Holy Toledo, it’s Angelina Jolie, amigo
She told me "Yo, Shady just hand your penis to me, I’ll deep throat,"
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we’re gonna see, bro
Who was a fantasy, I don’t mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna 'rassle?
I shove a fucking jar of Vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed Lexapro broken up with the capsule or Paxil
Just in case I ain't dope enough with the raps, though
Coke is cut with tobacco, smoke it up, then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a coconut with Tabasco
Shady let go, the ho has been choked enough, let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
I used to love her hooters now Carmen Electra's cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I’m off my fucking meds, but I’m on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jason's face while I vomit on Freddy Kruegar
They can’t even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I’m gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
Cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew 'cause...

There’s no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, jeez
There’s no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
Cause I will never lay down
And I will never let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

With the soul of a Shaman
I'll eat a beat then vomit
Like a bulimic woman with an uneasy stomach
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
So can you hear me coming
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
It’s probably got diseases on it
I’m just being honest, I can see the comments
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Shit I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money
I'm diarrhea on the track so it needs plunging
Somebody please tell these girls to release my undies
Nobody really understands my language
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
But still I got a whole lot of patience
Sittin’ back watching Earth from my Space station

There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bedingfield in a washer
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
It's like I got ya hypnotized and I forgot ya
My God, ya psychologically fucked
Michael would like an apology, what?
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I’m as cold as a muthafucking icicle i'm a nut
I ain't nuttin’ nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post traumatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I’ve been in a while
This is the closest that it's come to the 
Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don’t paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
("He can’t say whore"), of course he can, man he just saw her fanny
Then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties

There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

"This bitch, came to the club, with an overnight bag. She was so ready. She came, to the club, with an overnight bag, with a separate set of clothes in it. Took her shoes off. This bitch was back in the car with me and fuckin' B.o.B, tryna talk to B.o.B's friend, with her overnight bag. Had done fuckin' changed shoes. And I was like, 'wait a minute B.o.B, isn't that the same bitch from earlier tonight? But she in a whole different outfit?' And this bitch had a plastic bag READY. Ready for her fucking vacation. Just fuckin' crazy. YES! A 24-hour vacation. She was fuckin' ready. For the 24-hour trip of a motherfuckin' lifetime. And she knew what she was comin' for before the club opened. She packed! She probably had some wet wipes in there, like everything. THAT GIRL was crazy though, you know she was crazy. AND THEN was like, 'but I got a boyfriend' - BITCH, you don't have a boyfriend! Fuck outta here. That was the crazy shit. Remember that?"
 
 
 
Yes, I feel the end, the end is close
The same thing happened eons ago
To know exactly you have to read up some more
Everyday technology speeds up some more
As is above, so is below
Some feel the heat, yet some feel the cold
We are the souls, yes, we have been chose
Some roll with angels and demons and ghosts
But shh! Hold up, Bob, don’t go there!
You know that they watching, the all-seeing stare
But they can’t stop me, I’m already there
And y’all ain't seen shit but y’all already scared
I’m gone, high like fructose, fructose
You wanna know the truth? Really, you don't, you don't
It’ll blow you out your mind, like a UFO, UFO
I’m basically a resident of Pluto, Pluto
You know, but you’ll probably be the same one hatin'
Sayin' every rapper is in the freemasons
While the cops giving out free mace to your face
Now how do that taste? I’m outta my mind
These videos tellin’ y'all lies, bruh
Tellin' y'all we holding evil hand-signs, bruh
Last time I checked I’m from the Eastside, bruh
So do your research and make your own mind up
’Cause us musicians have influence on this mic
But they don’t like that, so they conquer and divide
Double-H N-D, hip hop never dies
So shoot all you want, but we fly
Because, you know, no one man should have all that power
Obviously ‘cause it’s only one power
But nevermind, y’all keep worshipping Towers
While the clock keeps handing y'all hours
But pucker up because the truth gets sour
More sour than the sour diesel I devour
Hear me by the hour, I give you 50 vowels
When I brain storm it's like a shower
So pull out your towels, 
and don't let 'em play you
Do your own thing, fuck what they do!
And if you good at somethin' make sure they pay you
And if not, take a thankyou
Whether they praise you, or whether they hate you
It’s all about the attention that they pay you
Y’all on that grape drink, try this grape juice
Shouts to Grand Hustle, 
we got that break through
And, yes, it’s evident we better than
The rest of these competitors
Really there ain't no one else ahead of us
Yeah, I bust these verses off, et cetera, et cetera
‘Cause they watching y’all like the Federers, owww

Kadoish, kadoish, kadoish
Adonai Tsebayoth
It’s B.O.B. and I’m out. Peace!

I really don't know how long I been doing this shit
I guess 2010's the first year that you gave a shit
I was the underdog, so please excuse me a bit
I need some space so someone please make me some room in this bitch
Cause I’m in beast mode, feast mode
Gimme those beats, I eat those
All day I don’t sleep, no, I don’t even know what I got sheets for
Them pillow cases and bed frames, oh no, take that, don’t need those
So high I don’t get high, I don’t even know what I got weed for
People, I’m in beast mode, why’d you think I got these teeth for?
Why do I rep that east side and why do they all call me B.O.?
But see, I knew this beat before anybody fed my ego
Back in the hood at east shows, so we take hood wherever we go
Please know, I am as loyal as loyalty is when it’s gave
Dedicated, determined, dependable
Yes, I committed myself to the game
Don’t be letting them tell you them lies
We make the industry real when it’s fake
So stay meditating so your head is facing
Into the direction that you aim, bitch
Okay then, know what my name is
Excuse my language but I’m fed up with the same shit
They say they love me, but its really cause I’m famous, see
My momma told me this back when I was nameless
So fuck y’all, I’m shameless, I’m a beast unleashed, I’m raging
I’m living inside of this Matrix, this video game that I’m playing
I ride around and they praise me, I crack a smile and they waving
I guess you could call me David Ruffin
I’m circled in the temptations, huh
Or maybe I’m angry, maybe I just need a little more patience
Or maybe I’m crazy, maybe I just get a little too anxious
Sometimes I rhyme like I’m inside Einstein's mind
Look at the time fly by, plenty of times I died
Looking at these jive guys claiming they lost they mind
You ain't really seen shit, nigga
Till you had the whole world flipped upside down
Right side up from the DEC so the Eastside’s up
Fired up so you know
When I get to the booth I go ham, cause I gotta do what I can
So I’m like "kadoish, kadoish, kadoish, Adonai Tsebayoth" I chant
I’m kinda like a blur with these words
Guess I'm more absurd with these verbs
Running at a hundred kilometers, man
Pretty soon I’ma leave Earth
Earthlings, or whatever, human beings
I’m a beast, you're a feast, curly fries, onion rings
This is not a fucking game, ain't no referee’s involved
This is military combat soldiers standing guard round my yard
Entourage, ham squad to be exact
Smoking ham, smacking back
Take your girl, have her back
We don’t want her round my team
She’s a slut and she’s a freak
But you don’t know cause she’s discreet
I swear I see everything that's a bit
Man I’m fed up to my neck with the stress
I could use a wish; Hayley, where you at?
I guess the only exception to these girls is that I rap
But I only attack
'Cause I’m in beast mode, just beast mode
Everybody know that I’m a motherfucking monster
Monster... Energy Drink shoulda been my sponsor
But sometimes I wonder, what is this race I run for
I give a fuck about numbers so I do find it ironic
These niggas get mad at me
Talking all sideways with they eyes glazed
They mad cause I’m straight, what the mind sees, the eyes say
And they say that I went pop and the streets say I ain't hip hop
Well if it's not, then the shit stop
 
 
 
What ever happened to Bobby Ray, he used to be here for us
Then he got famous and left all of his fans in the dust
We never hear from you, you’re constantly changing
And your relatives always miss you at family occasions
And your mother misses you too
Since all the fortune you’ve been too busy recording
Now she feels unimportant and your daddy’s been going through it
Since he lost his mother
The least you could do is call him and show him, you support him
I never thought you would sell out
You’re becoming so cocky
I asked you for a picture after your show
You walked right by me, I’m like
Ain't this the dude that said that it ain't about the price tag
Now on your records all that you do is brag
Come on, Bob, I thought you was better than that, dawg
What happened to Cloud 9 and Generation Lost?
You were my idol, just when I thought I'd give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody…)

I heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody…)
Da da dum Da da dum Da da dum
Da da dum Da da dum Da da dum
(melody, melody, melody)
Da da dum Da da dum Da da dum
Da da dum Da da dum Da da dum

What ever happened to B.o.B, he once was my favourite
I swear to God that I had all of his mixtapes on my playlist
He was hood, but so different at the same time
It was like a breath of fresh air, everytime he rhymed
And everybody was on him and the world fell in love
The girls, the money, the lifestyle, all the above
I guess he’s stopped giving a fuck for all of his little people
With your shades on, we can’t even see you
Is that what happens, when somebody makes it off of rapping
They taste the fame and change like it's just automatic
Where’s the integrity? You're on that other shit
You don’t even sound the same, I liked your other shit
But we’ll still stand beside you, cause somewhere deep inside you
There’s more than what meets the eye
I swear on the Bible you were my idol
Just when I thought I give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody…)


I watched my whole life change in a couple of years
Who woulda ever thought I would have caught the world by the ears
I swear, this shit is so much bigger than I had figured
But if it wasn’t meant to be this wouldn’t be my career
It’s like, people only see it the way it appears
But they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears
Blood, sweat and tears. We cry blood, all we sweat is tears
In the middle of this rap game on the battle field
All of these shock jock interviews, tryna phone me
You never know who’s gonna try to play you and make you look phoney
I live and die for my team, these niggas are more than my homies
We put it all on the line, we gave up all our belongings for this rap shit
Cause at the end of the day, it ain't just rap shit
I call it making a way for our survival
Just when I thought I gave up on everything
I dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody…)
I dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody…)
Da da dum Da da dum Da da dum
Da da dum Da da dum Da da dum
(melody, melody, melody…)
Da da dum Da da dum Da da dum
Da da dum Da da dum Da da dum
I dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody…)
Da da dum Da da dum Da da dum
Da da dum Da da dum Da da dum
 
 
 
Born into competition
With a feeling that something's missing
Bred in a corn addiction
With a synthetic composition
On the brink of a civil war
Or the forming of one religion?
I wonder what came first
Dinosaurs or Darwinism?
Pledging allegiance to a flag
Since elementary
Writing curses in cursive
 and casting spells
Stung by the spelling bee
And they says congratulations
You graduated
From slavery
To paid slavery
You actually made it!
Here! Take this gown and cap and wave it
Like a celebration of going to school just to get a job to pay for it
Like a nation that traded it's minerals in exchange for paper payment
Here, these are your gods, you have to praise 'em
I wonder who we'd worship if we weren't captured and traded
Consider this my affidavit
Yo, It's the ruling class
Here to rule yo ass
Prescription drug thug cocaine mule yo ass
Agricultural skills sure would suit yo ass
But they say, living off the land is a useless path
Here, work for dead Presidents, HA! fooled yo ass
Any revolutionaries, they remove yo ass
Fast, click clack, quick blast, in a flash
Whiplash from the kickback of the impact
Push yo shit back
As long as my head is intact
I'll be as political as I want
Because I get taxed
Nah, this ain't no fuckin diss track, to distract
Or useless chit chat, or syntax, or
Who's ass is this fat and who has a six pack
Who's batting this average, or
Compare his passes to his passes
There's a thousand sports channels
You can get this package, or this package
Who's this savage?
Hey, let's compare your emotional baggage to my emotional baggage
And see who calls each other bitch fastest
Haters go out they way to fuck up my day
But I ain't even worried about your bitch asses
And it's quite the optic, hard to take your eyes off it
They make the sky toxic
Prescribe the antibiotic
Make a high profit, divide the margin
You could die off it
If you do, they hide the autopsy
What the fuck are you supposed to do?
Morgellons in your kosher food
What the fuck is even kosher food?
Third generation crops won't produce
Be careful who you keep close to you
I'm from Atlanta, but shots out to my Oakland crew
They say, "Bobby Ray, the older you is overdue"
I say hey, sorry I got a little caught up exposing truths
I used to think, what would Hova do?
Now I think, what the fuck would Macho Man and Hulk Hogan do?
Now, if Steve Austin was America, and the Rock was Afghanistan
Then Russia and China would be Triple HHH
And the Illuminati would be Vince Macmahon
Now when the haters are The Undertaker
The crowd doesn't stand a chance
When the international bankers are walking through the stands
Slide yo ass some Xan
You think you a fan but you really just a lamb
Niggas start trends every day but don't never get no pair of Vans
What the fuck is an advance?
Niggas live on colored people time
What the fuck is in advance?
Tsh, I don't fucking understand
I just want my fucking bandz
I'm a walking talking human conundrum
Like a Muslim going HAM
Looking for the promised land
False stories of Christopher Columbus
Holding Pocahontas' hand
Black History is the shortest month
I just hope you understand, when the
Native Indians don't get shit but
Thanksgiving and some yams, like
Here, here's a few casinos, huhh, sorry we took all your land, huhh
Well, let's just move on, because, America's great!
Man I fucking love it
Democratic or Republic
Lightning rod, change the subject
All of these religions, I'm glad I found one
All of these beliefs and mine's the right one
Trying to process all this info you hide from
Till you wake the fuck up out on the advice son
Culture and religion condition your mind hon'
Whatever's prohibited, imma defy them
The smell of freedom is making my eyes run
To authority, i'm the antithesis
I'm not a pacifist, or a philantropisist
I don't got all the answersises
I just got a louder mic, and better stanzasas, bitch
Oh i'm sorry, did I offend you?
What the fuck you think goes on in schools you send your kids to?
What the fuck you think they serve for lunch, what's on the menu?
That's why only ratchet shit is what these kids is into
A language comprehendable
Friends do what they friends do
People act so fucking hard but really they just gentle
Psychological children
Grownups with issues
Grownups with children
Who grow up with issues
Cancer tissues
Abandonment,  misuse
Subliminal marketing screaming, "Here, let me fix you
I have the cure
I have the remedy
I am the savior
I am not the enemy
But give me your money, give me your money, give me your money!"
Everybody's in debt
But this is a free country!
They dock your pay, what a mockery
Why you on the clock
Hickory, dickory, dockery
They want cable, they want coffee, they want comedy
Anything to take they mind off being property
Trying to say it properly
Working on my tact
But I am the anomaly
They know i'm the shit like a elio-colonoscopy
They know i'm the shit by just looking at my discography
They know i've been sent to awake this idiocracy
Mass media, hipocrisy
Turn you into a worker bee
Harvest the honey tree
I'm just being honest, b
Mother Earth quakes underneath
Father Sky, up above the sea
God the father, the sky
Son of God, the Sun
Amun Ra,
 the Eye
No more Amen
No more folding hands goodbye
Adios, au revoir, bandz
 
 
 
You don't know who you're fucking with
Ain't no Democrat, and by far I'm no Republican
This is the type of talk that'll probably piss off my publicist
And I ain't even started, the water ain't even bubbling
The type of talk that'll probably get me in trouble with the law
Or make the government come after me in public
Won't hear this on the radio, this here is not for publishing
This ain’t that bubble gum shit, no, this ain’t that Double Mint
Consider this a risk, I swear I see them building pyramids brick by brick
They'll aim at anyone bold enough to go against the shit
You don't believe me? Look what happened to the Dixie Chicks
It's like nobody else complains
Until you try to be more than a nigga with a chain
Cube already told you: "they corrupted everything"
And we're just out here trying to function, trying to maintain

A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray my prayers make it through the clouds
I pray in heaven that them fuck niggas ain’t allowed
A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud
Until then it's back to the paper route, the paper route

And of course, it's unfortunate that niggas out here robbing for Jordans
Can we not afford them, but got enough to get a Glock 40
Is our views on reality kinda distorted
But still, even though I understand the story
I still fall weak for a booty that's proportionate
On the sexy short bitch, so what's the score?
Chilling with some Red dogs, drinking White man's poison
Now that's a forfeit
Selling what's for free, that's extortion
But still I'm wondering what families were present when history was recorded

A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray my prayers make it through the clouds
I pray in heaven that them fuck niggas ain’t allowed
A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud
Until then it's back to the paper route, the paper route

You think you really know what's going on?
They're passing laws where they can run up in your own home
Cameras on your laptop, TV and your iPhone
The battery don't come out, that means it's always on
Smile and say cheese, yeah niggas, gotcha!
I told you fuckers three years ago about The Watchers
If you don't take the microchip, then you can't make no dollars
This ain't no lovely day for a neighbour, this ain't no Mr Rodgers
Don't let them fuckers rob us for our freedom and our rights
And you be like: "it's on the news so it must be right"
Who's pulling the strings? Who's rolling the dice?
Who's calling the shots and who's starting the fight?
Think twice...

A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray my prayers make it through the clouds
I pray in heaven that them fuck niggas ain’t allowed
A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud
Until then it's back to the paper route, the paper routeYo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried  'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons, Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "Goddamn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it
Pinkprint, ayy

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky 
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, 
treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga; I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "b" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean "pop-pop-pop," then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Young Mula, baby!
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

Two things I'm about it, talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?

I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this

Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important

Here go some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (Brrr)
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot

That 808 woof-woof, 'cause I ride it good
And bitches can't find they man, 'cause I ride it good
I'm the wolf, where is Little Red-a Riding Hood?

Now, if you see a itty-bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her, "Park it"
I don't fuck with pigs, like "As-Salaam-Alaikum"
I put 'em in a field, I let Oscar Mayer bake 'em
And if you see a itty-bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her, "Park it"
I don't fuck with pigs, like "As-Salaam-Alaikum"
I put 'em in a field, I let Oscar Mayer bake 'em

It's like I just single-handedly annihilated, you know, every rap bitch in the building
Like, like, I'm Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinsky, Nicki the Ninja, Nicki the Boss, Nicki the Harajuku Barbie
Like, I mean, I don't even know why you girls bother at this point
Like, give it up! It's me!
I win! You lose Hahahahahahaha
Oh, shit! Hahaha, yo

I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch

Hahahahahaha
I told you, I told you before
I told you y'all was gonna have to pick my fruit out
Now listen, in addition to pickin' my fruit out
I want y'all to start going to the boutiques
Know what I'm saying?
Get some get some get some crazy shit for me
I want, I want, you know, leopard-skin, and, you know?
I want, I want all that crazy lizard-skin shit, like, you know?
Make sure you...
You can be my personal shopper!
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
Aaaaayyyyooooo!
WOO!
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, UGH!
 
 
 
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, "Yes, I suppose"

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes
The last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
 
 
 
RedOne
Uh

Let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get a wave
They say what they gonna say
Have a drink, clink, found the Bud Light
Bad bitches, like me, is hard to come by
The patron own, let's go get it on
The zone on, yes, I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'ma blow off my money and don't give two shits, oh-oh

I'm on the floor, floor

So give me more, more

I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment, I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of (Yeah)
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

What I tell them hoes? Bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to your knees
Young Money the mafia, that's word to Lil' Cease

Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the CEO, 
500 Degreez
Shout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold

These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man

I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
Plasma
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki,"
 
asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' Fraggle Rock, beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, "Why, God?"
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear the mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Roman, Roman, stop it, stop it
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad
You and this boy Slim Shady
What's going on? They'll lock you away
They'll put you in a jail cell, I promise
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed, run along, let's go, come on
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys
 
 
 
You should say it right now

Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

Its a heart for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's crying
Its trust for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's lying
 
 
 
Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns
(Who you gettin' at, Nicki?)
Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body?)
Fuck yeah, 'cause a Queen is what I embody, uh

If it's really your passion, would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes, whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat, and tears in perfectin' my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day

Big wigs, with a suit and tie
And them big things got two inside
Fuck wrong wit' these ho niggas?
Don't do coke, I don't blow niggas

Smack bitches, no smack cam
Closed fists, no back hands

Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin'
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
1-50, I'm really with it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man 'round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it

I'm a young nigga, I be gettin' money
Take your bitch from you
And these niggas don't get no respect
I'ma stay 100 'til I'm six under
Matter fact, I gotta keep it 150
For every nigga that's gon' come with me

And a blue Bentley, it do 160
Smoke a lot a of weed, like fuck kidneys
Put a dutch in me, got a 40 on me
I don't trust any, and if any nigga ever try to end me
I'ma die shooting, prayin' God forgive me
You too busy hating, you can't get no paper
Why are y'all so silly? Straight killers
I can call so many, I don't love no bitches
But my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki
I'm in Hollywood, came from Kingston Food
Shorties standing, in the streets with tools
Where I'm from we don't play no games
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news
Where I hang, we don't say no names
If you talk to cops, I stay away from you
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations
You'll be out the station, in a day or two
Dedication and a little patience
Lead to domination on my way to greatness
Don't put yourself up in a situation
Puttin' my relations, in your conversations
Shoot a opposition, with no hesitation
You get my position, then you better take it
Know some young bulls from a while back
Tryna leave the game but they never made it
I got old shit, killin' your shit
On a couple tracks I just never played it

Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think that I know

O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, the crying game

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game

Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want, is to love and be loved (to love and be loved)

I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone, 'cause the tears don't end

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think that I know

O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, the crying game

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game

O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o

You'd make twice as much if you switch it up, just to see
To you, he's rich and famous, but he's just a guy to me

I feel like I'm King Kong, name still going ding-dong
It's two girls gettin' more money, and they don't rap, they sing songs
I stay with that pink on, pink furs and them pink thongs
Goons out if they blink wrong, think hard, but don't think long
Pink Friday had Eminem, spit hard but I'm feminine
Iconic trio on Monster, Goblins and Gremlins
What's left that I didn't do? You bit the forbidden fruit
You thought you'd get my spot? Who the fuck was kiddin' you?
Took a lil' break, but I'm back to me
Tryna make a new Nicki, where the factory?
They'll never toe to toe on a track with me
There'll never be another one after me
'Cause the skill level still just a half of me
Blasphemy, my niggas will blast for me
All these low IQ hoes baffle me
Tell 'em that I wash bitches take a bath for me
Bunch of trophies in my crib like a athlete
I see them giving fake love but that trash is weak
Man, you know that I ripped, every rapper beat
You know Nicki gon' eat, Bon Appétit
Used to get real hype off a half a mil'
Used to get real high off a half a pill
We don't pay niggas to front like they like my shit
We don't pay niggas to come in and write my shit, uh

Now carry on, now carry on

Swish, swish, I'm just gettin' my Curry on

Can I, can I, save you from you?
Cause you know there's somethin' missin'
And the champagne that you been sippin'
Not supposed to make you different all the time
Starting to feel, like the wrong thing to do girl
Cause with all that recognition, it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from

I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?
For your type

I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you

So who am I to judge you on the past girl?
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothin' like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me
Down right now, it's too late
I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?
For your type

Uh, yeah, uh, look
Dress hangin' off your shoulder, barely sober
Tellin' me how you movin' away and startin' over
Girl quit playin' you just drunk, you just sayin' shit
And oh you dance? Dance like how? Like ballet and shit?
Oh, wait, no I get it girl, I'm wit it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like ya second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothin' new except for someone new
But how you s'posed to find the one when anyone'll come with you?
Talkin' to myself but I never listened
Cause man it's been a while and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'ma take you anyway you wanna go, let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again about how reckless I have been
And I'm slowly runnin' out of all the time that I invested
Makin' all the same mistakes and I'm just tryin' to correct it
And I fall

I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?
For your type

I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you

I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now
It's been so long for me, I don't know how, by now
Been drowning in the sea of broken vows, by now
But I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now

I've been chasing my dream, now I'm chasing you
Running hard but my legs feel weak
I done played every part, I done played a fool
Write the movie, I'll be your lead

Cause I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now
Well girl you stole my heart now take a bow, by now
In love by now
Well I'm supposed to walk you down the aisle, by now
Change your name and make your parents smile, by now
Leave the Church, make plans to celebrate, by now
A big old house and babies on the way, by now

I've been chasing my dream, now I'm chasing you
Running hard but my legs feel weak
I done played every part, I done played a fool
Write the movie, I'll be your lead

Well I'm supposed to be in love today, by now
Go through my phone and throw 'em all away, by now
In love by now
Without your love, what would they say when they write my stories
Without your touch, I'll never know how it feels to fly
Drown in my emotions, now it's all on me
Eyes are finally open to love I couldn't see
Can't wait 'til I can say bless the day you landed in my arms

I'm supposed to be in love by now
I'm supposed to be in love by now
In love by now

She went and did me real wrong, I mean (Yeah-eah-eah...)
I did the same thing to her but
She ain't have no right to do me like that though dawg, for real
(Yeah-eah-eah...)

You, been seeing him, and I know
And I was with her, and you knew about it
But I was too bli-i-ind to see it baby
And you was out here doing the same thing as me
I wanna ask, has he been by the crib?
Has he been in our, car? And did you let him, drive?
Cause she's been by the house, she's been in the car
I've even let her push the Porsche around a couple times

Oh, we were so the same
I don't know why I can't see it baby
And it ain't a point to feeling blue
You're just like me and I'm just like you

You're just like me, shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bub, giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me, she don't know how to act
On the floor backin it back, man I can't be mad
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me...

Now it's so easy for me to imagine what you been doing baby
So I don't even have to ask (No)
Cause you ain't the only one that's been keeping secrets baby
So it ain't no sense in me playing back
And I, can't say nothing cause I did you wrong
And I was on some bullshit when I let that bitch up in our home
She's also known just like me
And she played the game like one of my homies


You're just like me, shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bub, giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me, she don't know how to act

Just like me-e-ee-e-e (In the club, throwing ones, man she)
Just like me-e-ee-e-e (24's on the Range)
Just like me... (Go on shawty do your thang)

Hey!
Shawty who you fooling? You, know I'm way too cool for you
To run that game when we play me, trying to do me like I be doing you
Say you heard I was screwing her just like I hear he doing you
Why you worried about me doing me? I see you doing you
I can make her better though, you gonna let him ruin you
Just for the record know I wouldn't have her unless I could have the two of you
I know why he pursuing you, that booty do be moving boo
Late night, straight pipe, that ain't nothing new to you
Wait a minute, can't tell me shit, wanna tell me something, tell me this
If I would've never would've hit that chick, would you even ever know that dude existed?
Naw, got me twisted, yo ass goodbye I've kissed it
Now you all on his dick, shawty look at this bitch
 
 
 
Verse 1: Jamie
When I first saw you
I said oh my
That's my dream
That's my dream
Oh, I needed a dream
When it all seemed to go bad
Then I find you
And I have had the most beautiful dream
Any man's ever had
Verse 2: Beyonce
When I first say you
I said oh my
That's my dream
That's my dream
Oh, I needed a dream
To make me strong
You were the only
Reason I had to go on
Hook:
You were my dream
All the things that I'll ever knew
You were my dream
Who could believe they would ever come true
And who could believe
The world would believe
In my dreams too
Bridge: Jamie
Before, you appeared
Life was only a game
And day in
And day out
Were the same, oh
Beyonce:
Now a dream
Coming true

See it shine
Both:
A dream
That is yours
That is mine
Jamie:
You were my dream
Beyonce:
Now I got dreams of my own
Dreams you'll never know
Both:
You won't take my dream from me
When I first saw you
I said oh my
I said oh my
That's my dream

And I find us a rhythm making you quiver
It's so different I'm into your symbol like instrumental beats
Fall back, fall, I'mma leave for that son and go back
Fall back, fall, when I leave I need drum roll, please
And applaud when I depart, break you off any song playing these com
But be cautious, I beat the breaks off you, no days off, everyday Team Barker

Got nothing but my t-shirt and boxers on
Waiting for you to get home

Wanna feel your raindrops fallin' down all on me
That thunder from down under surrounding me
Coming down hard pounding me

Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come

Lights out like a power outage
Cause of the lighting in your bedspring showers
I can feel the mist everytime we kissed
Just didn't know a downpour like this
There's a flash flood warning
Till we wake up in the morning
There'll be puddles in the bed
The weatherman said
Girl the rain is coming

Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come

Girl the weatherman said...
Its cloudy skies, right there between your thighs
I'm pluckin' for scattered showers, for about an hour
Rain on me tonight
Now let me love you (love you and soon I wanna kiss you)
And girl let me kiss you, (all over you) let me
Sex youuu, (I just want you to) rain on meeee, yeah

Girl, Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
 
 
 
Steppin' to the bad side
Gonna take a mean ride
The smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay
Both: Stepping to the bad side today

Steppin' to the bad side, ooh, ooh, ooh
Gonna take a mean ride, ooh, ooh, ooh
The smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay
Steppin' to the bad side today

I tell ya now, it's got to end
No more trusting them, my friend
We're gonna change our style, change our tone
Look for songs we sing our own


I got you all the breaks you need
In just two years, we'll be in the lead
Just sit back, it's plain to see
Open your eyes and trust in me


I was a man who tried to be good
I was always misunderstood
Halfway there, they told me
You got to get down and show your dangerous ?

(x2)
Steppin' to the bad side, steppin' to the bad side

Singing their big new hit, here's James Thunder Early and the Dreamettes, singing their #1 hit, "Stepping to the Bad Side"

Stepping to the bad side, stepping to the bad side

I had to step into the bad side
I had to take myself a mean ride
You know the smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay

Steppin to the bad side(Dreamettes: Today)

Man just stole my woman from me
Took her down to Tennessee
She was the best girl I ever knew
If it wasn't for him, she'd still be true
I've always been a good man, it's been said
Dammit, that man, I wish you were dead
Men like him make good men mad
Starting today I'm gonna be bad
 
 
 
 (Justin Timberlake) 
T.I.P. (yo, uh)
Aye Jamie, JT 
I'm 'bout to get back hot again man
You know I'm fresh out that thang, let go (talk to me)
I'm so up there and so out there, you so not here
Hey, hey, you see we so up there and we so out there
(Uh, yeah, let me get it right here first, hey!)

I'm wakin, up in the morning
Hustlin to the stage, if I've been performin
Bustlin through the hay and bustin the door in
Lately nothin messes up my step and scorin
And speakin of the Misses, I'm watchin 'em pour in (uh)
Just like a drink that I'm enjoyin
And don't mean bottles, you welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin, feelin like Jordan

(Aaah-ah) hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again
(Aaah-ah) You ain't heard I'm the shit
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you lookin at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you lookin at winner, winner, winner
`Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner

I'm steppin out in the evening
Keep winnin and screamin
You gotta be cheatin but I'm so breezy
I make this look easy
And y'all thinkin I'm seasoned
You gotta believe me
I went from TVs to screens to DVDs
To CDs to MP3s overseas
I got, no time, the talking is boring
Just look at me soarin, feeling like Jordan

(Aaah-ah) hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again
(Aaah-ah) You ain't heard I'm the shit
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what


That's right, you see the, Porsche Panamera, got 'em in hysteria
The turbo super fast and that McLaren even scarier
Hear me turnin corners, burnin rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once I pop the clutch and hit the throttle
I'm recession proof, I don't run to money, money run to me
In this economy, guess I'm considered an anomaly
Bugattis, Maseratis, new Ferraris, I got one of each
My future bright, tight like the pussy out in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection, to failure I'm an exception
Fuck if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessing
You couldn't die at the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best, no Auto-Tune
Been in the lead, say you seen King follow whom
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back, money long as a old Cadillac (*laughing*)
 - w/ T.I. ad libs

Hey man, you thought a little vacation was gonna hold me back homeboy
Man, I'm back man, brighter than ever
You understand that?
If you didn't like me then, ha, you gonna hate me now nigga
 
 
 
Well its been 5 years
Can't hold back my tears
Cause I'm just so happy I'm marrying an angel today oooo
As I take your hand
I pledge to be your man
I vow to love to hold to cherish
And never disrespect the love we share
I'll be honest I can not lie
There'll be real good days
There'll be some bad times
I'll be standing right be side you my sweet baby
With the love of mine
And you take this ring
And i place it on your sweet and lovely hand
We will show our kids
They will tell their kids
What mom and daddy did
On the day I married my angel
I love you my angel
 
 
 
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down
And get closer to you

Get a little closer to me too
I get a little shy when we start to move
I get a little high when I'm tryna decide if it's London or China too
Forget about the plans that you got later
I kiss you like you can't have too many
The Earth is like round and round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know
So in the meantime I'm here and I'm gone in love,gone in love
Because you chose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above,above,above

Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love

Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down
And get closer to you

Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down
And get closer to you

It's Kid Ink, uh
So come and walk my way
Roll up, I can spark that flame
There's something about the way you make that face
Girl is you talkin' to me, whoa?
Let's start with the drink, pour up
Get you and your friends toe up
Don't sip slow on the low though
Wait, tell me what you here for
I could read the signal, girl, you bad, sinful
Body just like a centerfold
But you probably got a nigga though
If anybody ask, I don't know him
Couldn't just let you pass me and ignore it
Doin' all that cute shit
Took a couple shots and got shot by Cupid

Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love
 
 
 
Yeah, girl, you so sexy though
As she just lay at your feet

I wanna see what's under there, there
Now put it in the air
Yeah, load it on my Macbook Air
It's a new form of macking, don't be old fashioned
Update your passion
Only reason why I be iChattin'
Is when it's time for some action
I wanna hit it way, way out like John Paxson
But for now I just gotta watch her practice
Send her a picture so she see it
She says, I-I-I can't believe it
Ohh, she all on me, on me
Ohh, I think she want me, want me
I think she showed her homies
Why? Cause all the homies on me
Ayo, all the digital gonna have to do for now
But I'mma break it down when I get back in town

I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes, oh
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
I love you, girl, girl
You look right in the screen and take it off, off
See I can't wait till I get a little taste of you
And I just upgraded to 10-80i, hi def just for you

My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

My homies never seen you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I'll type you a message for the next send off
You shoot me a video and then I load
Even though I hate this distance it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

Not a day goes by shawty
Without you on my mind, shawty
Hey, don't care what you wear
Baby, I wanna see what's under there

When you seen the picture cut off the face
Now cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC search till I reach third base
And when I get home I'mma hit home plate
Wait, would this be considered our first date?
Yay, this picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cook coked cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
And pose in the mag like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian and be a lady addict
You know what's a crazy thing?
A girl would make you wait longer than AC Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty three year old virgin
That's disrespectful, baby, don't encourage him
I like them brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress white but my swag so urban
Tryin' my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby, you up, question mark
And she reply YES-S-S-I-R

My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl
 
 
 
This is just the start of your story

(In New York City)
And now's the time you gotta stand tough
Cause if you work hard you can rise up

You know we're the same when we start off
Four walks, two heads, one heart paired

So take it all, the city's yours

Tell me have you heard the story
That took place not long ago
Bout an angel up in heaven
They say she up and ran away from home
Word is she had unfinished business
So back on earth she had to flee
Well you know I'm so elated
Because she's laying right here next to me
And when God woke up that morning
And he called out her name
And when she did not answer
Heaven will never ever ever be
Heaven will never be the same
 Heaven will never be the same 
Always dreamed that it would happen
I just didn't know exactly where
All my life I'd been waiting for something amazing
Said it took a while but now I know
So tell me can I get a witness
If you believe in miracles
And the proof I have is living
And my life will never ever be
And your life don't to be the...
At times it seems we take for granted
How precious life can be
Just hold on and I'm sure you'll understand it
Bringing into this world
A precious boy or a girl...And when God woke up that morning
Said where has my little angel gone
And when she didn't an...answer
Heaven will never ever ever be
Heaven will never be the....same
Yeah....Yeah

And so I'm giving more to you than I though I could do

Made to love each other, made to be together for a life time
In the sunshine
Flying in the sky
I know I'm feeling so much more than ever before
And so I'm giving more to you than I though I could do

Letting you and I, fly love

Last night me and my dogs were hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today so it's alright
But all those ups and downs had me in a twist
Started dancing with this model chick
And then every record became my favorite song
And that is all that I remember

Cause I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the Embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

When I woke up from last night's avoutrie
Baby girl was laying next to me
Shoes and clothes were scattered everywhere
I got dressed and got up out of there
But not before I called for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
Everything that I remember


Extravanganza
Extravavganza
Only was an extravaganza
Yes it was the things that I remember
And I remember

We messin' with Grammies, we messin' with Oscars
You messin' with that dranky drank
Plus you puffin' on that stanky stank
In the morning you gon' draw a blank
The hotel said y'all was on 'em
My girl wasn't on shit, I picked the wrong one
Steady talkin' bout I ain't like them other girls
Well tonight I'm tryin' to find them other girls
Bring they own rubber girl
Never meet ya mother girl
You know they love it when you love 'em
And they tell they friends girl

And I have had the most beautiful dreams any mans ever had

When I first saw you

That's my dream
That's my dream
I needed a dream
To make me strong
You were the only reason I had to go on

You were my dream
All the things I never knew
You were my dream
Who could believe they could ever come true
And who would believe
The world would believe
And my dreams too

When I first saw you
I said "O My", "O My"

Cause I just want your love to stay
Tonight, tonight

Girl, I’m not a travel agent so what you trippin’ on
You say I think I could make it happen cause I’m famous
Nah, I’m just tryna get it cracking cause we faded
Get you to my crib, spend some time alone
Barely over 21, that mean you kinda grown
Ummm, and I’m tat, tat, tatted up
Come on to that bread, I’mma stack it up
Where you going? Baby girl back it up

You gon need a scarf, wrap your head cause it’s gon get wild

A daughter, a son, whichever one
Girl your second to none

We off the Patron and both of us grown

You could been anywhere in the World
But you’re right here with me girl
And if we go home and make love

Oh. As I take your hand, I'll pledge to be your man
I vow to love, to hold, to cherish and never disrespect
The love we share

There'll be some bad times. I'll be standing right beside you

And you take this ring, and I'll place it on your sweet and loving hand

She said I got a drinking problem
But I don't got no problem drinking, though
I solve my problems with the bottle
And drink until I feel my face no more

She said I got a drinking problem
But I don't got no problem drinking, though
I solve my problems with the bottle
And drink until I feel my face no more

Walk up in the club, she grabbin' up on my Denim
Pouring out a bottle, I spilled it up, I ain't tell 'em
Said a couple of things, she probably think I meant 'em
Shorty want a ring, I call her but I don't settle

Rockstar, she know I'm a rockstar, pull up in the black boots rockin' gold chains
Rockstar, she know I'm a rockstar, I know it'll kill me but I'll never gon' change

She said I got a drinking problem
But I don't got no problem drinking, though
I solve my problems with the bottle
And drink until I feel my face no more
She said I got a drinking problem
But I don't got no problem drinking, though
I solve my problems with the bottle
And drink until I feel my face no more

Demons comin' so it's hard for me to relax
My fam worried, don't wanna see me in rehab
My vision blurry, it's hard for me not to relapse
So fuck it, I've been drinkin', I'm scared of death and I mean that
Bad habits, I smoke it like I'm a drug addict
I try to quit but seemingly I'm not good at it
Fucked up rockstar in a Denim jacket
Bury me with some roses inside a leather casket

She said I got a drinking problem
But I don't got no problem drinking, though
I solve my problems with the bottle
And drink until I feel my face no more
She said I got a drinking problem
But I don't got no problem drinking, though

So we should probably just be homies

I don't feel the same way as I did
When we were flirting over text
We would split a bottle, hit the club
And come home lookin like a mess
Roommates started buggin' 'bout the noises
And the bruises on your neck
Everything was cool until you started catching feeling
Getting stressed (Getting stressed)
And I ain't sayin' that you're wrong for it
But that just really ain't my vibe
Like girl, please
How can you expect for me to act like you ain't got one on the side?
Got me like

Living like a race
Ain’t no sign of stopping I’m on pace
I can see them plottin' it ain't safe
She know that I got it on the way
Told her get up out my face
I need diamonds on my face
Only came for the baddies and the drinks
Gettin' bands give a fuck 'bout what you think
Watch what happens when I give a little wink
Clean money got her hands up on the sink

And she know
We been living fast
Homie we ain’t going slow
Foot up on the gas
When I'm whippin' through the coast
We don’t go to class
But you know we honer roll
Yea you know we honer roll
That might be the molly in her cup
She just put the taste up to my tongue
Now she prolly thinking I’m the one
Told her pour another drink
Then I sip it till it’s done

Living like a race
Ain’t no sign of stopping I’m on pace
I can see them plottin' it ain't safe
She know that I got it on the way
Told her get up out my face
I need diamonds on my face
Only came for the baddies and the drinks
Gettin' bands give a fuck 'bout what you think
Watch what happens when I give a little wink
Clean money got her hands up on the sink

And I’m on one
If I sipping on it, it’s a strong one
She just seen the check and it's a long one
If i take her home then it’s a home run
Hit it like a home run (This ball is crushed)
She a bad thing
We might get it poppin' in the backseat
Out in Hollywood but we ain't acting
Running up the money like a track team

Living like a race
Ain’t no sign of stopping I’m on pace
I can see them plottin' it ain't safe
She know that I got it on the way
Told her get up out my face
I need diamonds on my face
Only came for the baddies and the drinks
Gettin' bands give a fuck 'bout what you think
Watch what happens when I give a little wink
Clean money got her hands up on the sink

So let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me

Girl I ain't spendin' that shit, this ain't mine
Girl I'm rentin' that whip
And if you out for the money
Then I'm sorry little honey
'Cause I ain't yo man, better end that shit
Oh, you need that cash? Go ask your dad
Heard he got them racks, 30k in a mattress
Met this bad bitch who heard I was rappin'
Found out I was broke
And disappeared like magic
O-o-o-o-o-oh my god, news flash
They don't want you they want a new jacket
And some brand new shoes, that's two stacks
And if you don't got the cash watch 'em move fast
Out of that door, out of yo life
Left for the cheques, and that don't sound right
Havin' sex on jet, new man got bread and she ain't comin' back
But that's a round trip flight
And sorry if that's all new to you
'Cause I don't really mean to confuse you dudes
But some girls see a man with a couple of bands
And give them brain for some change like a tutor do
I call them gold diggers
I don't roll with them, makin' money with her body
That's a hoe figure
You can buy her drink, ain't goin' home with her
'Cause she leave you for dude who got the chrome spinners
Damn

Good lookin' so refined
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's goin' on in my mind?
So let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me

Hunned bills for the meal, I ain't payin' that shit
Bitch yea I got some money, I ain't sayin' I'm rich
But if the waitress bad then I'm layin' that tip
'Cause these hoes chase that bread
Why do you think they all love Panera?
Unless they drop straight to they knees
Then I don't ever come near 'em
'Cause I whip that Malibu, SKRRT, no Ferrari
But it just stalled out, I gotta go restart it
Made a song with carnage, and a girl responded
AZ you so special and that flow retarded
But I know what she thinkin', she her for the guap
But my green is mine I ain't sharin' my guac
She swear that she love me, don't care about the cost
But the next you know she be wearin' my watch
I should F.D.B; Fuck That Bitch
But her body so dope, you could cut that brick
She gotta ass so dumb
Man you think she the one
But she'll be copping all yo cash if you cuff that chick
So don't play with her games
You know how these skanks go
They take your money and leave
That's why they call it bank roll
Oh no

Good lookin' so refined
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's goin' on in my mind?
So let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me

This is what I gotta do, can't be regrettin' when I'm old

Brand new places I'll choose and I'll go, I know
Embracin' this news I behold unfolding
I know, I know, I know it don't feel like it's time
But I look back at this moment, I'll see that I'm fine
I know, I know, I know it don't feel like it's time
I set boundaries for myself, it's time to cross the line

True say, I want and I need
To let go, use my time to be free
It's like it's always what you like
It's always what you like
Why it's always what you like?

F-f-freezin' like the fuckin' winter

Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
(F-f-freezin' like the fuckin' winter)

My flow so cold, you notice it (Notice it)
My dreams unfold, behold this shit ('Hold this shit)
Had my life rearranged, it's strange as shit
Not the same as before, I changed a bit

How you leave your son all alone?
See you every other month
Can you hit a nigga phone?
Mama, can't believe you let that nigga
Turn you from your home
You ain't even who you used to be
The person that I've known
Guess I have to carry on (F-f-freezin' like the fuckin' winter)

Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on

My flow so cold, you notice it (Notice it)
My dreams unfold, behold this shit ('Hold this shit)
Had my life rearranged, it's strange as shit
Not the same as before, I changed a bit

Worry 'bout my health
Bad thoughts, when I'm gonna die?
I like to get high 'cause it distract me when I wonder why
'Fore my grandma died, I wasn't there, I wasn't by her side
Knew that she was dying
Didn't put my selfish shit aside (F-f-freezin' like the fuckin' winter)

Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on (F-f-freezin' like the fuckin' winter)

My grandma died, I shed some tears
My mama lied, she left me here
I keep secrets, can't tell a soul
Trust me and myself, that's all I know
My family split, can't live like this
No reunion shit, just who that is
I just pretend it's all okay
I'ma kill everything that's in my way

My flow so cold, I must admit
My dreams unfold, behold this shit
Had my life rearranged, it's strange as shit
And not the same as before, I changed a bit (F-f-freezin' like the fuckin' winter)

Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
 
 
 
Lyrics from Snippet

Romantic talkin', you don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is green and white
Baby, you livin' the life with me or you ain't livin' right

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, don't think you're the sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

Hmm, hmm
Hmm, ah
 
 
 
SEGA
All tests needed
Glock, Glock, Glock, yeah
Wet, wet, wet, wet

Tick tock, big clock, "I miss you Nas," bitch, stop
All this ice, fuck a price, gotta keep my bling right
All this damn green, I'ma motherfuckin' fiend, right?
All you niggas trash can't rap, dance, sing, write
What the fuck, I can't stop motherfuckin' going in
Spent some yenny yens in Thailand just to buy gin
All he rap about is violence, move in silence
Niggas try to try me it's gon' be a fuckin' crime and
I ain't really with all that cappin' and shit
You pussies yell over a beat and call it rappin' and shit
I'm rookie and I'm out here snappin', I done mastered this shit
You pussy bastards get captured, fractured, and splattered and shit
Uh, you a quick jugg, yeah, hope you understood (Huh?)
That stick-up give you hiccup, give it up is what you should
Yeah, I fuckin' run it, I'm motherfuckin' Sonic (Okay)
Raised in the hood, I got my gun and niggas runnin'

See, I run shit, dumb bitch, go try out the phonics
Done wit', bum shit, I fly out to London
In my town, you better not get found
Call my hittas' Netflix, cause they make you get down, blit blow

I can't wait to blow, wait to take off like a Migo
Shoutout latinos, despegando en cinco
I think I'm the best, King Kong, I beat my chest
Come wrong, nigga, you dead, give a fuck about a vest
'Cause (Why?) I'm aiming for your head (Yeah)
That A.R. stand for "Ayy, you niggas gettin' left on read"
I came up off of Twitter doing motherfuckin' threads
Gotta keep at least three shooters, that'll lay you niggas dead
Came fast like Paul, I can make a call
Knock you niggas off while I'm shopping at the mall
Killin' every beat, I need time to grieve
I keep them receipts, hittas' stomp you on concrete
I just lit a blunt, finna grunt in this bitch (Grrr)
Yes I am your dad, and you're my son in this bitch (Papa)
You niggas bums and only bought some fuckin' ones in this bitch
I guess I'm runnin' out of puns, just havin' fun in this bitch
Niggas on my dick, yeah, make em' sick, yeah
New whip just hit a lick, yeah, sonic shit, yeah
Niggas on my dick, yeah, make em' sick, yeah
New whip just hit a lick, yeah, sonic shit, yeah

Yeah, sonic shit, yeah
Yeah, new whip, yeah
I just hit a lick
I just, I just hit a lick
I just hit a lick and I got a new whip, uh
 
 
 
Yeah, what? Yeah, what? Yeah, what? What?
Yeah, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm killin' these niggas, they calling me cocky
Niggas is mad and nobody can stop me
I'm in my bag and there's no need to brag
And you niggas get smacked, I'm your dad and your papi
I'm finna blow, I already know it
I spit hits, I'm a fuckin' poet
You niggas shit, you need to fuckin' quit
You take potential hits and then you fuckin' blow it

I hop on this beat I'm finessing
Look at these blessings
All of my exes from Texas
You niggas is guessing that I will start stressing
Fall back to depression just 'cause yo' rejection
I kill beats, these instrumentals
Niggas talking 'bout, "He got potential"
Niggas joining groups, tryna be Avengers
Scared to stand alone, scared to disassemble
I'm droppin' shit way before December
Be afraid, hope you do remember
In the Escalade, drinking Ace of Spades
Doing escapades, yeah, I do adventures
Droppin' shit, you know that I'm poppin' shit
I switched up my swag and they copied it
Got in my bag and I pulled off the tag
And I don't mean to brag on my mothafuckin' cocky shit
Niggas is, niggas is wack
Smokin' on crack, I am on fire like Jack
I do the same thing as Thugger
When cops come and pull up
Yeah, I put that brack in my brack
Niggas corny, niggas whistle blow
Niggas kiss ass, nigga mistletoe
You gotta thick ass? You should let me know!
I make big cash, Giuseppe' toe

I'm killin' these niggas, they calling me cocky
Niggas is mad and nobody can stop me
I'm in my bag and there's no need to brag
And you niggas get smacked, I'm your dad and your papi
I'm finna blow, I already know it
I spit hits, I'm a fuckin' poet
You niggas shit, you need to fuckin' quit
You take potential hits and then you fuckin' blow it

You blew it!
Yeah, nigga you blew it!
Had the mothafuckin' ball and you threw it
You had the screw and you didn't even screw it
Yes, I am Lil Nas and I'm 'bouta get to it
I shit on you niggas, right now I'm just farting
Enter the game, all you niggas departing
You won't be bragging about yo' Ferrari
I'm killin' you niggas and, no, I'm not sorry!

I'm killin' these niggas, they calling me cocky
Niggas is mad and nobody can stop me
I'm in my bag and there's no need to brag
And you niggas get smacked, I'm your dad and your papi
I'm finna blow, I already know it
I spit hits, I'm a fuckin' poet
You niggas shit, you need to fuckin' quit
You take potential hits and then you fuckin' blow it
I'm killin' these niggas, they calling me cocky
Niggas is mad and nobody can stop me
I'm in my bag and there's no need to brag
And you niggas get smacked, I'm your dad and your papi
I'm finna blow, I already know it
I spit hits, I'm a fuckin' poet
You niggas shit, you need to fuckin' quit
You take potential hits and then you fuckin' blow it

Lyrics From Previews

If I say so, know they gon' ride
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
Tell my mamma, I don't want it, but I get by
Tell the devil I can't have him inside
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright

I smoked myself to sleep, I'm sad, I think I'm feelin' lonely
Took one too many shots last night and I spent all my money
Oh, my nigga, tell me who said you can't own it?
You can own anything right before your eyes
Oh, my nigga, if you knew that, I'd be on it
Woulda did anything just to spoil my rise
Wanted fame, I just got a ticket
It can happen, can I get a witness?
Started focusin', nothin' but business
I'ma finally see all the riches
I keep things to myself, so I promise they'll never know me
Old people in my life should know that I am not the old me (Old me)

If I say so, know they gon' ride
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
Tell my mamma, I don't want it, but I get by
Tell the devil I can't have him inside
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright
 
 
 
Ricky!
It's in the trunk (Yeah, yeah)
Pop the trunk and let you meet lil' Donald Trump (Pop it)

I got thirteen hammers, need a reason why
I should clap a nigga, send 'em in the sky
All you rapper niggas finna run and hide
I got that yoppa, pussy niggas finna die
Got a choppa, call it Donald Trump
'Cause it's loud as fuck and it hate niggas
Got some llamas, leave 'em in the trunk
Call 'em fishin' rods and you the bait, nigga
Yeah, my name is Lil Nas
Bitch, never call me Lil Naz
Cause if you do, I promise you, I'm coming through and I'm bustin' ass
Got a lot of cash in the stash
If you touch that then you getting splashed
Got a bad bitch with a thick ass
She a stripper ho, yeah, she get cash
My flow incredible, Swae Lee, unforgettable
Pussy niggas keep talkin' shit
I'ma having singing to the medicals
I don't fuck with no federals
Fuck 12, them niggas terrible
They set you up, yeah, I know what's up
So I keep it tucked and accessible
Yes, I'm in college, I'm smart as fuck, here come my degree
Don't let that knowledge fool you, boy, yeah, I know the street
Could've been a alcoholic, poppin' mollies, all I smoke is weed
I'm so hyperbolic, it's hydraulics on my fuckin' Jeep
Wait, I mean my damn Lamborghini
I do it big, never did it teeny
Bad bitch, polka dot bikini
Shootin' niggas, like eeny, meeny
Miny, moe, catch a fuck boy by his toe
Take his ho, if he talk shit, let it blow
Leave that nigga six feet below (*gunshot*)
Shoot a pussy nigga like *gunshot*
Pull up on twelve like *three gunshots*
Ain't no pretending, all my niggas winnin'
We trending, we sendin' them *three gunshots*
Pick up the Glock, nine on the dock
Blow yo shit up, like we up in Iraq
Sellin' them rocks, I Milly Rock
You niggas can't rap
Go get back to ya job
 
 
 
Run that money counter, baby, mhm, hmm, hmm
Pour that shit up, Trvpyyy

When I get some wins, I'm complacent
Might blow up go buy a new place and
Right now, I still live with my mom and my dad
But I’ll skeet on your face in that basement
See, I fuck with crackers and Haitians
I'm rapping, they say he gon' make it
I really think ain’t no more rules to this rap shit
I really think Josh could be Drake'ing
They thinkin' that I got hella' guap
Did you love me 'fore I got it? Not
Gucci on my socks
It's too cold, I can't take it off
I see hella people watching me because they envy a
Nigga moving up, I got my old friends acting friendlier

Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(Run me my paper)
Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(No time for haters)
Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(I told my neighbors)
Run up them bands up
(Can you pardon that water vapor?)

When I get the guap, I'm complacent (’Placent)
You watch what you say, when you say it (Say it)
Lil’ nigga, I might just be friends with yo plug
If I give him the paper he lace it (He lace it)
See, I might get head in a Wraith and (In a Wraith and)
Go plot for the world domination ('Mination)
See, I’m tryna get to the tippity-top
To where Kanye and Jay-Z adjacent
I'm poppin', like, I'm already on
Turn this up, this yo favorite song
Lotta niggas on, trashy songs
They won’t last too long
'18 set me up for '19
It's gon' be a killer year
Was rich in my past life
All this money look familiar

Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(Run me my paper)
Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(No time for haters)
Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(I told my neighbors)
Run up them bands up
(Can you pardon that water vapor?)
 
 
 
Lyrics from Snippet

Ayy
Titanic, Titanic
Ooh, I know you want it
Ayy, ayy 
Titanic
ArubW produced it

I can't be with you right now, I know that's what you wantin'
I gotta stay iced out, I gotta get this money
'Fore we even fuck, I guess I'm givin' you the warnin'
I might leave you down bad, call that shit Titanic

Ayy, it's Titanic, ooh, I know you want me
See you lookin' at me, know you wan' give me the 'nani
Ayy, bought that Rosé, we've been here for four days
Give you want you wanted, then you act like you don't know me
 
 
 

I don't wanna be without you, babe 
I don’t want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath 
without you, babe
 
I don’t want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me
 just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way
 

I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew
No love, more drugs
No love, more drugs
But, I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew, ayy
No drugs, more love
No drugs, more lo—

Uh, yeah, I lead you on
Wish I could speak my feelings without running to a song
Yeah, you told me 'bout your mom, that shit ate me up
I could tell you need a shoulder, still didn't give a fuck
I could never get enough, of shittin' on people and just regrettin' it
Barely giving respect, but I want respect, just expecting it
Worried about my future, I’m burning bridges affecting it
People who show me love, I always end up neglecting
You thinking you made me do it, get to you, can’t get through it
I know you peepin' my pages, I know you peepin’ my music
I know you listening now, find it interesting now
Shit, if I was you, I'd probably feel sickened now
'Cause I left without even saying, you probably thought I was playing
Was I okay or alright, you probably was out here praying
You wanted the best for me, used to get dressed for me
But I can't be with you, I’m addressing my destiny, uh

I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew
No love, more drugs
No love, more drugs
But, I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew, ayy
No drugs, more love
No drugs

Ooh
I need more drugs, ain't no love good for me
I'ma need to be all on my own, think it's good for me
Ooh
I need more drugs, ain't no love good for me
I'ma need to be all on my own, think it's good for me
Good for me

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way

They didn't see the bigger picture, now they cropped out
I just made a fucking hit, didn't have to pop out
Bitch, you just now rootin' for me 'cause I got clout (Pop, pop, pop)

Finish line, huh, finna cross it, yeah, I'm trying, huh
You a worker, what? Gimme fries, lemon-lime
No, I ain't ever gettin' caught if I commit a crime
I tell the jury I was at home eatin' clementine
I got all these problems like I'm Jay-Z but it's 60
, uh
Nobody to guide me, hope this label never trick me, uh
To keep it a hunned, I can't split this fifty-fifty, uh
I blew by myself, so I might need my riches filthy, uh
Soakin' up all this fame, huh
Old Town just banged, huh
I just hopped in this industry
, I think I opened up my own lane, huh
And you know what's real crazy? Huh
Parents told me I was lazy, huh
Was pushin' shit on the internet, now I'm up there with Lil Baby, uh
Splash, splash, splash, splash, splash, I keep scorin'
Don't send me that link, lil' nigga, you know that it's boring
Crazy how quick I woke all these niggas up from snoring
Crazy how sick they gon' be when I really start soarin'

Ayy, bitch, I dropped out, huh
They didn't see the bigger picture, now they cropped out
See I just made a fucking hit, didn't have to pop out
Bitch, you just now rootin' for me 'cause I got clout (Pop, pop, pop)

Lyrics From Snippet

Say you one of me, 'cause I need the validation
Need to watch your speed, think you causin' fascination
Put you in that box, what the fuck you think you sayin'?
If it ain't "Old Town Road," Lil Nassy ain't playin'
Nigga, just stick to what you best at
I suggest, make a song like this
Yep, I'm switching up with pros, lil' nigga you ain't good, huh
Just because you can that ain't meaning that you should, no

I like this, I don't like that, huh
Do this here, don't you do that, huh
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah
I like this, I don't like that, huh
Do this here, don't you do that, huh
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah

You's a meme you's a joke, was a gimmick from the go
All the things you would do just to get your face to show
So you think you big shit, big pimping, let me know
Ain't the next big thing, you the next thing to go
Now, can you prove yourself? Everybody waitin'
I'm just being real, swear somebody hatin'
I don't see you lasting long and that's just me being honest
Even if your album okay, it's flopping, that's a promise, oh

I like this, I don't like that, huh
Do this here, don't you do that, huh
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah
I like this, I don't like that, huh
Do this here, don't you do that, huh
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah

Oh, oh-
 
 
 
I know you really like it
I see, like I'm a psychic
My shit get lit, excited
I know, don't try to hide it
I know you really like it
(You like it, don't ya)
I see, like I'm a psychic
My shit get lit, excited
I know, don't try to hide it

My shit slap, it get you off your feet, off your feet
Nasarati dropped, you got it on repeat, on repeat
They post a shady tweet and then they hit delete, hit delete
I'm who these goofy niggas really wanna be, wanna be
See, you wanna be in front of me
These niggas, they confronting me
I'm running with the money and I'm shunning bums and wannabes
I'm flippin' dough and switchin' flows
I'm rippin' out reciprocals
I'm whippin' in the kitchen with some niggas that's from Mexico
I make a cake, sell it
Buy an eighth, smell it
That's just for this round, I'm cuttin' down on the Henny
You niggas ain't prevailin', tellin' all my felons
Ashamed, but my chain ain't finna do no damn derailin'
I'm the hottest motherfucka', I roll like a trucka'
Doin' shows on these sucka's, I might go and fuck ya' motha'
I might just fuck a cougar, I kill it, Freddy Krueger
Go no where without my ruger
Him right there? Yeah, that's my shooter, uh

I know you really like it
I see, like I'm a psychic
My shit get lit, excited
I know, don't try to hide it
I know you really like it
I see, like I'm a psychic
My shit get lit, excited
I know, don't try to hide it

Lyrics from Snippets

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
But it's not nowhere yet

Tell 'em that the break is over (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)

We need, uh, need to do something
Need a couple number ones
Need a plaque on every song
Need me like one with Nicki now
Tell a rap nigga I don't see ya, huh
I'm a pop nigga like Bieber, huh
I don't fuck bitches, I'm queer, huh
But these niggas bitches like Madea, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, oh, let's do it
I ain't fall off, I just ain't release my new shit
 
 
 
Uh, I ain't made one for the ladies yet
This one for y'all
Uh, uh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Ayo, throw that ass back
If you tryna get this money, get this fat stack
I must admit, you is the shit, I wanna grab that
Put that putty on my Woodie, that's a fat cat
Uh, ayo, throw that ass back
If you tryna get this money, get this fat stack
I must admit, you is the shit, I wanna grab that
Put that putty on my Woodie, that's a fat cat

Uh, ayo, I guess tonight she going in
Throwin' and she rollin' and she hoein' wit her friends
Slowin' with the motion, gotta hit em with the spins
She ain't showin no emotions, no, she got some thick skin
So I asked her if she ever fucked a rap nigga
Said she did, but they really couldn't rap nigga
Said she was a shooter, so you know she like to clap niggas
Said, "Nas, do you wanna see it clap, nigga?"
Yeah, she a meanie
Her body poppin' like genie
She molly poppin', get steamy
She probably got me, she dreamy
She twerking that fuckin' thang
Her pussy poppin', she creamy
She working up at the flame
She clocking in when she leave me
She building up and she stackin'
Packin' and never lackin'
Ass fillin' up, it's clapping
Throw backwards like it's pig latin
From trenches like she be trappin'
Full of herself, no cappin'
No snitchin', she never yappin'
Hit bitches, she steady slappin', uh!

Ayo, throw that ass back
If you tryna get this money, get this fat stack
I must admit, you is the shit, I wanna grab that
Put that putty on my Woodie, that's a fat cat
Uh, ayo, throw that ass back
If you tryna get this money, get this fat stack
I must admit, you is the shit, I wanna grab that
Put that putty on my Woodie, that's a fat cat

Uh, yeah, yeah
Why? 'Cause you beautiful, girl!
Uh, alright
I need everybody to the dance floor
Yeah, you too, you over there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you a CNA, a teacher
Twerk that ass all on the bleachers
Cashier or a nurse
Pop that pussy, then disperse
If you a stripper or a maid
Make it clap like a parade
Even if you unemployed
Twerk that ass, fuck what they say
CEO? Gotta degree?
Pop that pussy like Nicki
Even if you a social worker
Man, I know that you a twerker
Retail clerkers?
Them bitches flippin' burgers?
Oh my god, you killin' shit
Issa fuckin murder
This one for da' Rihannas
Them bitches from Weezyana
Them bitches who name is
Quisha, Biancas, and them Briannas
And even in the cabanas
And if you listen to Gunna
Them wifeys and babymamas
Them bitches whippin' a hummer
Oh, hummers all in the summer
Show that ass like plumber
Shake it fast like a Runner
Bitch, do that shit for Obama
Hop on it, cause some drama
Drop it in yo pajamas
Pop it in the Bahamas
You got that shit from yo mama
Uh
 
 
 
They in they feelings
They don't want they spot, nigga I fill in
I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing

I'm a problem, niggas know 'dat
Hop out, grab the black MAC, no Kodak
Rockstar like Jack Black, I'm playing like Mick Jagg
No playing, get rich fast, then sit back
Huh, soak it all in
I spoke it now it's happening, they hope it all end
Niggas rather hate than get in they own bag
It's funny because I always put money over that mad shit
Tell me, tell me what that fuck you gaining from it
Hating while I'm in the club and it's raining money
That shit is draining you, paining your fucking brain and you straining yourself out tryna get all that clout off my name

They in they feelings
They don't want they spot, nigga I fill in
I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing
They in they feelings
They don't want they spot, nigga I fill in
I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing

When my poor heart is breakin' apart
She'll put it back together
When my poor heart is breakin' apart
She'll put it back together
When my poor heart is breakin' apart
She'll put it back together
When my poor heart is breakin' apart
She'll put it back together
 
 
 
Lando made the track, so you know we 'bout to turn up

Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong

Thirty niggas with me and they shooting too
Nigga, they will shoot at you
Thus leaving you dead
Bust ya mathafuckin cuticles
Different color Gucci
Nigga I look like Rubik's cube
Putting fake niggas on trial
Like the crucible, delusional niggas
Thinking they up next, that's a shame
'Cause they name ain't Lil Nas X
Young nigga, I was raised in the projects
In the draft, I'm the number one prospect

Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong

Think I was meant for this rappin' shit
'Cause all the new niggas sent really wack as shit
Maybe if I change the game
I'll aim at lame niggas brains
And take the fame off they names
Then I'll give it back
To a motherfuckin' humble rapper
Conscious niggas always talking 'bout them mumble rappers
Like y'all shit can't be trash too
You niggas be wack too
Pussy fuck ya past, oh
You niggas gassed
My check better be getting to me
Or I'm wetting necks of niggas who didn't give it to me
Don't expect no respect, I never give it truly
Switch the pivot gotta get it, that's how I'm living, ooh-wee

Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong
 
 
 
Thank you, Ralph (Thank you, Ralph)

I just started rappin'
Niggas acting like we cool
You a fool, think I fuck with you
Just 'cause we went to school
Pockets blue, and I'm rocking trues
I could never lose
Rock with blue and them reds too
I don't fuck with you

Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't even crack a smile
Don't come around me saying
You ain't seen me in a while
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't DM on the gram
I am not your bro, I'm not your moe, I'm not ya fam
Pussy nigga, you don't know me

Let me say it loud
Only time I wanna see you is when I see you in the crowd
Tell that bitch, "Look at me now"
It ain't no Chris Brown
But I'm fuckin' poppin' and I fuckin' put it down
What other nigga got my sound?
Point me to his ass
I'm sick of y'all ass calling mid niggas gas
They comin' in last, yeah, in school they didn't pass
Thinking they was cool, 'cause they never went to class
Old peon-lame-ass, nigga, get your check up
Treat you like a ho, you better go get your respect up
I am on the road doin' shows, see me next up
My neck to my toe, I am froze, need a check-up
I think I'm the shit
I'm rich, I'm at the Ritz
I'ma take your bitch
If you don't get up off of my dick

Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't even crack a smile
Don't come around me saying
You ain't seen me in a while
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't DM on the gram
I am not your bro, I'm not your moe, I'm not ya fam
Pussy nigga, you don't know me

"My weekend like ya weekday"
I'ma play my mixtape for Drake, see what he say
I am on my way, like a nigga on the freeway
I'ma need my money now, I don't do no free pay
I don't hear no "He say," I don't care what bums say
I'm tryna be up there with them Jiggas and Beyoncés
My hitters pull triggers, go gorilla on a dummy
I'm ya father-figure, little nigga, you my sonny
All I do is win, might commit some sins
Patience running thin, finna bust a nigga chin
I don't understand how these niggas make amends
With niggas that done switched up on them, said they was they friends
All they do is follow trends, tryin' to fit in
That AK give you headache, you can't use no Aspirin

Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't even crack a smile
Don't come around me saying
You ain't seen me in a while
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't DM on the gram
I am not your bro, I'm not your moe, I'm not ya fam
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
 
 
 
Uh
Get it, get it, I went and did it again
Rip it, flip it, they say I'm switchin' on friends
They say I'm trippin', forestallin' myself within
I only trip when I trip and fall in that Benz
I'ma bake the feature for the right pricing
Cake the beat, I'm just the right icing
See, I'm inspired by Neil deGrasse Tysons
They inspired by squealers that's doing lifings
I get three hours of sleep, just to get better
These cowards, they out here sour at me, petty vendettas
I ain't ate right or took a pee, waitin' for cheddar
Workin' late night, oh, it's just me, David the letter-man

C'mon girl, get up

C'mon girl, get up
Come a little bit (Bit, bit)
My whole life I was under it!

Bitch, I'm really spittin' now, this is my career
Shoutout to the labels flaking on me, fuck they ears
You just lost your best player, 'Bron and Cavaliers, disappear! Uh!

They showin' love in this bitch
'Cause I'm blowin' up and they knew it would happen
In this rappin', I'm the new captain
I sat back, perfected my craft while niggas was laughing

Wait a minute, baby
Going too fast, I'mma turn back, ooh
Wait a minute, baby
Going too fast, I'mma turn back

Don't even know what we're fighting for
But damn, I need a minute
So baby, keep your distance
Heard it all, so I'mma just go
Don't bother waiting up, I just need some time alone
Damn, where the hell are my keys?
I just wanna leave
Get in my car, and now I'mma just drive all night
Turn off my phone, radio on, and drive
So I'm just...

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I can’t even deny
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute, baby
Going too fast, I'mma turn back
Thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute, baby
Going too fast, I'mma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Hey baby, I'm back and I calmed down
I've done with all cursing
I came to give you a little something
You got me screaming for a different reason now
Why we break up stuff, tearin' it up?
Neighbors hear you loving me down all night
I head to my car, I don't wanna go
But its getting late, so why don't I just drive all night?
Moving real slow, radio low, just drive
So I'm just...

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I can’t even deny
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute, baby
Going too fast, I'mma turn back
Thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute, baby
Going too fast, I'mma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Who I think I'm fooling anyway?
Drive around the block, and be right back to you
When all along, I knew I shoulda stayed right where I wasn't
Instead of drive and think of you
So I'm just...

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I can’t even deny
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute, baby
Going too fast, I'mma turn back
Thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute, baby
Going too fast, I'mma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home
 
 
 
Ohh, ohh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Boy, you let me down
I am so confused
I stood right by your side
Through everything that you went through
Why is she around?
Why are you so cruel?
How could you just turn your back
When I stood by you?
When you were broke, I didn't leave you
Somehow, through it all, I believed in you
No, no, not,my man
'Cause he would never hurt me
Let alone, just desert me
No, no, no
No not my man

Word around town
Is that you live with her
And you said she took your heart away, oh baby
I told them, that's a lie
Cause I don't wanna hear no bullshit stories 'bout my man
(Can't stop the screamin' and yellin')
Oh, no, no, no, no
My pain, oh no
No, I just can't believe that you're with her
Is she the one you played me for?
Shoulda noticed it the day that she walked in the door
I just can't believe she stole my man
Oh, my man (Oh, yeah)
She walked right in the door
Looked me in the face, and she took my man
Never trust a lonely woman with the one you love
She ate dinner at my table, even watched my kids
And she took my man
Bitch actin' like she was my friend
She called me 'bout her man
Well, I didn't understand
She was talkin' 'bout my man (heifer)
Oh my man, my man, my man, my man, my man
My man, man, man, man, woo!

Is this my life?
It cuts me like a knife
To know the one I love could leave me for a friend
I'm not desperate, but I would reconsider (baby, are you sorry?)
All the years I put in this thing to be a winner
I know it's too late
She took my man (took my man)

See, I was just a fool
Didn't wanna see the truth, and she took my man
And my heart screams out loud
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, woah (took my man)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (took my man)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (not my man)
Not my man, no, no, no (not my man)
 
 
 
I'd rather go blind, blind, blind
Than to see you with her tonight
I'm done with your lies
But I can't say goodbye
So, I'd rather go blind

See I remember, I remember that night
Til the mornin’ I just cried and cried
In the bed, no pillow talk
The way you left was cold and rough
It's ok cause you'll be back and you'll be mine
But where you go, where you go, where you go
I will never know
You just leave me here confused
Down, depressed and feeling blue
I’ve convinced myself that you’ll be back in due time

I’ll be praying, wishing, hoping that you notice me
But now you're surrounded by new company
I play it cool, but truth is that's a lie

I’d rather go blind, blind, blind
Than to see you with her, tonight
I'm done with your lies
But I can't say goodbye
So I’d rather go blind
Cause you was all mine, all, mine
And we had the time of our lives
Then I lost my sight
When I saw you that night
So I’d rather go blind
I’d rather go blind

Save your talkin', I know all the facts
Tell her it's over and imma take you back
Look me right here in my face
Cross your heart and say you've changed
But we both know that's not what you want right now
Now where you go, where you go, where you go
I will never ever, never know
You just left me here confused
Down, depressed and feeling blue
I just hope that you’ll come back home in due time

I’ll be praying, wishing, hoping that you notice me
But now you surrounded by new company
I play it cool, but truth is that's a lie

I’d rather go blind, blind, blind
Than to see you with her, tonight
I'm done with your lies
But I can't say goodbye
So I’d rather go blind
Cause you was all mine, all, mine
And we had the time of our lives
Then I lost my sight
When I saw you that night
So I’d rather go blind
I’d rather go blind

Baby, what the hell am I supposed to do without ya?
I’ll turn a blind eye just to solidify ya
Cause I need you back in my life

I’d rather go blind
Than to see you with her, tonight
I'm done with your lies
I can't say goodbye
So I’d rather go blind
You were all mine
And we had the time of our lives
But I lost my sight
When I seen yo ass that night
So, I’d rather go blind
I'd rather go blind
 
 
 
Don't just say a word to me
I don't wanna hear it
You say you miss me
I don't wanna feel it, I don't wanna feel it
If you really wanted to be
Oh, if you really wanted to be here
You would make a woman out of me
Oh, I would be the one that you believe in

You don't want my love, I swear, you don't want it
You don't want my trust, I swear, you don't want it
Gave you my all for what?
I swear, you don't want it
You don't want it bad enough, I'mma take it back

I don't want your pieces
Oh no, no, no
I don't want your pieces
Oh no, no, no
If you can't give me all your love
I don't want your love

It’s like you threw a curve at me
Can't you see I'm hurting?
Ooh, it's gonna be hard for me
I know that's where your heart been
That I'm where your heart went
Tryna let go of you, but I don't really know if I can do it
Close the door on you
You don't really wanna see me do it, no

I tried a thousand times
Told my heart a thousand lies
You won't let me say goodbye
You don't wanna see me do it, no

I don't want your pieces
Oh no, no, no
I don't want your pieces
Oh no, no, no
If you can't give me all your love
I don't want your love, no no
If you can't give me all your love
I don't want your love, no, no, no, no, baby

No baby, it's so clear
You leave me here
Wondering, dreaming, still believing
What you say but I'm not for it, baby
I don't know who you think you're playing
Boy, you know I'm the only one you're needing
Truth of the matter is you don't think I really have the strength to leave

But I don't want no pieces
Oh no, no, no, no
I don't want your pieces
I'm tired of giving all of my love
I don't want your pieces
Oh no, no, no, no
I don't want your pieces
Oh no, no, no, no

I deserve more than just a little part
I don't want nothing, if I can't have it all
I ain't even gonna play with something I can't keep
I want the whole thing or forget about me

You're asking how, do I really feel
And I'm asking now, how is this real
Oh, love is a plan, that we can't control
All I can hope, that I'll fit the role

No one will ever know how I feel for you
Throw me a love plan
When you don't say the words
I'm just sitting silent knowing that actions speaks more than words
Wanna have that something, knowing it means nothing
Baby, you're just bluffing
This is how I feel

Your pretty laughs, I'm longing to hear
I'll wait around, 'til this is real
Oh you played a mime, but I can't feel
Oh that when we're alone, our hums are sealed

No one will ever know how I feel for you
Throw me a love plan
When you don't say the words
I'm just sitting silent knowing that actions speaks more than words
Wanna have that something, knowing it means nothing
Baby, you're just bluffing
This is how I feel

Give me hope and a prayer
Say you'll be there
I must feel
I know you need
Say you love me

When you don't say the words
I'm just sitting silent knowing that actions speaks more than words
Wanna have that something, knowing it means nothing
Baby, you're just bluffing
This is how I feel babe
 
 
 
Sitting in the dark, off in my room, thinking of you
I'm at the brink of me breaking down
'Cause all these thoughts of me and you apart
Won't leave my head right now

Baby, baby, call me crazy
'Cause I know without you I won't be no good
When the latch on my heart comes unhooked

You should know if I don't have you
(Rocks me to the core, I can't love no more)
If I don't have you
(Know I'm done for sure, nobody worth fighting for)
I'll tear down these walls, that's on my life
I'll lose my mind if I don't have you
(If I don't have you)

Looking at my phone, but you ain't even call
I put it in the drawer 'cause I wanna be right next to you
If you wanna talk, baby, come on through
Before it's all done, tell me I'm your only one

Baby, baby, call me crazy
'Cause I know without you I won't be no good
When the latch on my heart comes unhooked

You should know if I don't have you
(Rocks me to the core, I can't love no more)
If I don't have you
(Know I'm done for sure, nobody worth fighting for)
I'll tear down these walls, that's on my life
I'll lose my mind if I don't have you
(If I don't have you)

It's way too late to start things over
Can't seem to get it together
We try, and we try, but we won't look wrong dead in the eyes
Let's try and make it right 'cause I don't wanna fight
Can't see myself without you in my life
Please don't say you're done with me
'Cause you're my baby, baby

'Cause you know if I don't have you
(Rocks me to the core, I can't love no more)
If I don't have you
(Know I'm done for sure, nobody worth fighting for)
I'll tear down these walls, that's on my life
I'll lose my mind if I don't
If I don't have you
(Rocks me to the core, I can't love no more)
If I don't have you, I know I'm done for sure
Nobody worth fighting for
Say, baby, I'ma tear down these walls and that's on my life
I'll lose my mind if I don't have you
Oooh, baby
If I don't have (You)
If I don't have you
Baby, baby, baby
 
 
 
Oooh, Oooh

When I said I do, I put it on my life that I loved you
And forever, that's my vow, boy, it's true
Won't let anyone come in between
You're the one, my everything
I just knew from the way that you hold me
From the way that you wrap me up in your arms
Says I'm the only—girl, that's how I know it's you

Your love feels like no space or time
Feels like a dream come true
Cause my forever is you
No wonderin' who I'll be with
It's like I've always known who
Boy, my forever is you

Oh, it's like you look straight through my soul
I'm brand new, oh ye-yeah
It's like we fly away pass the stars and the moon
And you should know how much you mean
There is no other man for me
I choose you—oh, woah
From the way that you hold me (Baby)
From the way that you wrap me up in your arms
(wrap me up in your arms)
Says I am the only girl
That's how I know it's you
(That's how I know it's you, boy)

Your love feels like no space or time
Feels like a dream come true
Cause my forever is you
No wonderin' who I'll be with
Its like I've always known who
Boy, my forever is you

I used to say that I was done
Done with love
But then you came in, and you never let me go
Now I know, I finally know
That it's you—it's you

Your love feels like no space or time
Feels like a dream come true
Cause my forever is you
No wonderin' who I'll be with
It's like I've always known who
Boy, my forever is you

You, you, you
You, you, you
Yeah
Cause my forever is you, babe
 
 
 
No, oh, oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, oh, no

Empty boxes is all I ever get
Just so grateful for the gifts, should've known by shaking it
There was nothing there for me
But to my surprise, as the ribbon hit the floor
I just truly could not believe there was nothing underneath
Don't know what I was looking for
Empty boxes can be so pretty to the eye
Could be much be lighter than you think
It will knock you off your feet
To know it was all a lie

You never know, when it goes so you better fight
Let it go when you're wrong, so you better try
Then you learn, you can't feel everything

Empty boxes
They're all over the floor
I'll think of every little thing that you ever did to me
I'll pack it up and cry no more
Please return to sender
Cause I no longer live here anymore
You'll never find my new address and I pray you'll do your best
To find a space for you to stay

You never know, when it goes so you better fight
Let it go when you're wrong, then you better try
Then you learn that you can't feel everything

So keep your empty boxes
Your lying boxes
Your cheating on me boxes
I can't take no more
I promise you boxes
I'm in love with you boxes
So empty, so empty, oh
Everything you said to me, you don't mean
So take your empty boxes
Help me, I don't want it back
Oh, take your empty box
 
 
 
You left your phone on the sink
So I grabbed it without thinking
I would hand it to you as I turned to leave
Later that night as you sleep
I was kissing you and we were interrupted by an unfamiliar thing

Ring, ring, ring
Three o'clock in the morning
She's looking for you
That's when I opened up my eyes
The words filled the room
I wish I didn't see what she sent to you
Oh, I'm holding your heart in my hands
Your heart's in my hands
Oh, I'm holding your heart in my hands
And I gotta know if it beats for me, oh
Only me, oh
Only me, oh
If it beats for me, oh

Went back and forth with my mind
Should I say that I don't know?
Should I stay or should I stand right by this door?
I shouldn't have but I did
Sending several messages just to see what she just had to say to him

Ring, ring, ring
Three o'clock in the morning
She was looking for you
That's when I opened up my eyes
The words filled the room
I wish I didn't see what she sent to you
(she sent to you)
Oh, I'm holding your heart in my hands
Your heart's in my hands
Oh, I'm holding your
Heart in my hands
And I gotta know if it beats for me, oh
Only me, oh
Only me, oh
If it beats for me, oh

I miss you
I need you
I can't wait to see you
I love you
I want you
Always thinking of you
Realize that's what I read
Feeling this pain in my chest

I hate it
The way my heart is breaking
Cause I'm holding my heart in my hands
My hands, my hands, oh
Does it beat for me, oh
Beat for me, oh
Beat for me, oh

Ring, ring, ring
 
 
 
:
Could've sworn we were in love
Thought I'd given you my all
But I'm standing here all by myself
Oh, once again I played the fool
While you stood and watched me lose
Cause I'm standing here all by myself
Oh, I broke the rules for you
Gave you the keys to my heart
Oh, you dropped 'em in the middle of nowhere
2x:
Where do I go from here?
(where do I go?)
Where do I go from here?
(where do I go?)
When my heart's a broken record
(heart's a broken record)
My heart's a broken record
:
I done seen this here before
Did not cry not one time more
But I'm standing here all be myself
Oh, I tried my best to make it work
I prayed so hard that this wouldn't hurt
But I'm still standing all by myself
Oh, Do you like when I'm undone?
Are my emotions apart of your fun?
Cause I'm still here all by myself
:
Where do I go from here?
(where do I go?)
Where do I go from here?
(where do I go?)
When my heart's a broken record
(heart's a broken record)
My heart's a broken record
(Oh, where do I go?)
(Oh, where do I go?)
 
 
 
:
I'm in pain like a window
It's getting harder to pretend oh
Cuz it's like I'm living with a ghost
Ain't nothing 'bout it natural
When you touch me I don't feel a thing
Conversations are one way
This side of you I've never seen before, yeah
:
What's got you acting so brand new?
(damn I'm so confused)
This just isn't you
:
Boy you look the same but I don't know you at all
It's like your number changed cuz you don't answer when I call, oh
Did I say something wrong?
Did I not put it on you?
I'm living with a stranger
You're lying here but it feels like you're gone
I'm missing you come home (home)
I'm missing you come home (home)
:
Damn, I hate the distance 'tween the sheets
A million miles 'tween you and me
You know I never ever ever cheat
But this ain't my man touchin' me
I ask what's wrong, you say you're fine
How dare you look me in my eyes
Cuz you ain't never been that good at lyin', hoo oh
:
What's got you acting so brand new?
(damn I'm so confused)
This just isn't you
:
Boy you look the same but I don't know you at all
(I don't know you at all)
It's like you're number changed cuz you don't answer when I call, oh
Did I say something wrong?
Did I not put it on you?
I'm living with a stranger
You're lying here but it feels like you're gone
:
I'm missing you
So you can stop pushing me away, I swear
And we're still in this together
We're in this together, oh oh
Let me be clear babe
I'll do whatever just to find you
To get you back where you belong, oh!
Oh oh oooh..
:
Boy you look the same but I don't know you at all
(but I don't know you)
It's like you're number changed cuz you don't answer when I call, oh
Did I say something wrong?
Did I not put it on you?
I'm living with a stranger
You're lying here but it feels like you're gone
I'm missing you come home (home)
I'm missing you (home)
Ooh I'm missing you (home)
Ooh missing you
Ohhaa mmm
 
 
 
We could walk away from this mess we made
We could live and learn
Set fire to this bridge and watch it burn
We can act like it was not even really love in the first place, no
We could throw out the pictures and throw our dreams away
We could forget the words we were too afraid to say
And we could live with the mistake, tearing us apart every day
We could let all the good just fade away

But I wanna stay and fight for you
Fight 'til my heart is black and blue
Fight 'til there's nothing left
Not one single strand of the love we had
I wanna stay and fight for us
Fight like hell before I give up
'Til I'm the only one, the only one in love, I'd fight for you

We could turn off our feelings, and go about the days
Put on the happy face
Tell everyone that we're okay
And we could just say you and me were probably never meant to be
Or we could be nothing more than a memory

But I wanna stay and fight for you
Fight 'til my heart is black and blue
Fight 'til there's nothing left
Not one single strand of the love we had
I wanna stay and fight for us
Fight like hell before I give up
'Til I'm the only one, the only one in love, I'd fight for you

Cause we done went through the fire, baby
We still survived, baby
If you know where I stand, then I'll be away
Cause it'll never be my choice, baby, to give up on us really
When it's so rare to find in the first place
When you're the realest thing I've ever met

But I wanna stay and fight for you
Fight 'til my heart is black and blue
Fight 'til there's nothing left
Not one single strand of the love we had
I wanna stay and fight for us
Fight like hell before I give up
'Til I'm the only one, the only one in love, I'd fight for you
 
 
 
:
Take a look at myself in the mirror
With these tears streaming down my face
Thinking how did I let myself get here
When I know, I should've walked away
Cause I'm sick of the same things
Over and over and over again with you
:
You drug my heart through the ground
Left it all battered and bruised
Done fighting this battle with you

I can’t keep going in circles
Circles, going in circles
Round and round and round and round with you
:
I’m scared but I know what's at cost
Leaves me with the deepest scars
Cut me open now I’m bleeding with hurt so sharp
Foolish of me to believe
Things would be different this time
Can't say I ain’t tried but we just keep living a lie
I’m sick of the same thing
Over and over and over again with you
:
You dragged my heart through the ground
Left it all battered and bruised
Done fighting this battle with you
:
I can’t keep going round in circles
Circles, going in circles
Round and round and round and round with you
:
After all of the things we've been through
Can’t imagine myself without you
Take me through all these changes
And to share you, I just can’t do
Taken all of my love for granted
Made me a fool
And I’m done with this breaking
I’m aching in circles with you
:
You drug my heart through the ground
Left it all battered and bruised
I’m done fighting this battle with you
:
I can’t keep going in circles
Circles, circles
Round and round and round and round with you
Round and round and round and round with you

(Verse 1):
You don't ever wanna
Take the time to love me
Get back to me slowly
Always in a hurry
What did I do to deserve this?
You don't ever wanna
Hold me in the morning
Taking all the covers
Never cuddle with me
You just don't know what I'm feeling
(Pre-Hook):
You treat me like I'm nothing
You take me for granted, you're trippin'
(walkin' round here like I owe you somethin')
Always going out my damn way
Just to keep you happy
Well since you wanna act like that I swear you'll
(Hook):
Never kiss my lips again
I promise that you'll
Never feel my love again
Never again, no never!
(Verse 2):
I don't think you ever
Even noticed that I'm
Always cookin' dinner
Like every single night
Tell me do you even care?
And I don't think you ever
Looked me in the eye
Tell me "baby thank ya
Cuz you do a lot"
I don't even know why I'm still here
(Pre-Hook):
You treat me like I'm nothing
You take me for granted, you're trippin'
(walkin' round here like I owe you somethin')
Always going out my damn way
Just to keep you happy
Well since you wanna act like that I swear you'll
(Hook):
Never kiss my lips again
While you walkin' round here like I owe you somethin'
Never feel my love again
Never again, no never!
(Bridge):
Since you wanna act like that
Imma pack my love and I ain't coming back
And since you wanna do me this way
Imma make sure I give your love away
And since you ain't really love me
Imma find one who on
And when you're alone
Don't be blowin' up my phone because you'll
(Hook)2x:
Never kiss my lips again
I promise that you'll
Never feel my love again
Never again, no never!

I thought that I knew everything about it
But then came you and ain't no doubt about it

Led me to
Led me to you
Hey baby..
 
 
 
Confidently, I did the thing a woman like me should never do
I stepped on a scale and thought "What the hell?"
'Cause, honey, that scale was mighty rude
So I've gained a little weight, mama's hair's a little gray
And my strength just ain't the same
But believe me when I say

I'd fight a bear underwater for my baby
Bring on a lion, I'm not frightened, they can't take me
I'd tear the stripes off any tiger
You just call me, and I swear
I'm right there and I'm not scared
Of lions and tigers and bears

A wolf or a fox, please
A big jabberwocky
You just gotta knock on your mama's door
I'll fight through the fire
But if there's a spider, well, honey
That's what your friends are for
I know sometimes we don't agree
But I'm always on your team
And if somebody ever get mean
If they try to take a swing
I'm gon' hit that gangster lean
Somebody hold my earrings
Let me get that Vaseline
'Cause they gon have to go through me

I'd fight the real Loch Ness monster for my baby
I'd slay the dragon and I'll drag 'em 'cause I'm crazy
I'd scare the stripes off any 
Call me, and I swear
I'm right there and I'm not scared
Of lions and tigers and bearsEnviyon on the mix
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me
 
 
 
Mhm, they're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Hey, these girls are insane, yeah, uh

All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh, no, she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

Ah

Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
 
 
 
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, uh
I can't breathe , I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
 
 
 
I usually don't speak on shit like this, but
Ain't nobody else saying shit
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth

What's the 27 Club? We ain't making it past 21
I been going through paranoia, so I always gotta keep a gun
Damn, that's the world we live in now
Yeah, hold on, just hear me out
They tell me I'ma be a legend, I don't want that title now
'Cause all the legends seem to die out, what the fuck is this 'bout?
I'm tryna make it out, I'm tryna change the world
I'm tryna take her out, I'm tryna take your girl
More importantly, I'm tryna change the world
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah

I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth

My mind is foggy, I'm so confused
We keep on losing our legends to
The cruel cold world, what is it coming to?
The end of the world, is it coming soon?

Now, ooh, ooh, oh
That hit's for you

I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth

Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)
 
 
 
Man, what? (Haha)
This shit funny, one sec
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

Oh-ooh (Oh-ooh)
Uh (Uh)

All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous, yeah
I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah
Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Takin' medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)

Over ice, I'm freezing
Beautiful eyes, deceiving
We may die this evening
Coughing and wheezing, bleeding
Hi, I'm anxious so
Blood moons are my eyes, stay low
Red and black, they glow
Under attack, in my soul
When it's my time, I'll know
Never seen a hell so cold
Yeah, we'll make it out, I know
We'll run right through the flames, let's go

All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous, yeah
I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah
Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah, uh)

I'm in too deep
Can't swim like me
We're drowning, so I will sing
My demons turn face under me
Inhale, exhale, but I can't breathe
Too busy drinking codeine doin' high speeds
Crash (Shh), pour a four, sip it slow, make the time pass
Take a pill for the thrill, have a relapse
Devil in my head tryna run gym laps
I ain't tryna race, he don't even know me like that

All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous
I know that the truth is hard to digest
Five or six pills in my right hand
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)

I will sing
 
 
 
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Told her if I die, I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real

Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me

Got dreads in my head, used to pray for the lock up
I hit from the back and my legs start to lock up
Jacuzzi that booty, I gave that girl flakka

Rose on my chain, there's no hint like no copper

Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty

Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos

I ain't suicidal
Only thing suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up (Uh)
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to the racks, all them niggas want war
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of livin' in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission
Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'

Oh my God, Ronny

The devil hit my phone, he wanna talk
But I'm not really up for conversations
I can have my cake and eat it, too

Chillin' in my head, but it's hot
Flames everywhere, I see Satan
Demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
Really, really runnin' out of patience

T— Timing, timing, timing
All about timing, timing, timing
Sit back in my chair, relaxing and reclining
He has not a care in the world, no, I'm lying
Takin' all these meds to the face got me flying
Takin' all these meds to the face got me dying
Smoke 'til my mind frying, eyes red, high and crying
Numb the pain with Oxy and Dior, yeah, pricey
Juice like 2Pac Shakur, no ice tea
Givenchy, Louis V, Double V, icy
Wedding ring, better things, better half, wifey
Only things numbing me from this hard life thing, uh, alright

Really, really runnin' out of patience

Waiting, waiting, waiting, contemplating
My heart racing
Feels like I'ma die every second of the day
So I gotta get high
Ain't no coming down, ain't no coming down, why?
My anxiety bring me down, that's the fucking downside
It's like every time I ball, I just end up off-sides
This light of mine goes dim tonight
Will I be alright?
Let me guess, no answer, right?

The devil hit my phone, he wanna talk
But I'm not really up for conversations

Fine, fine

Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

I know I have a purpose, but I don't see the purpose
They tell me the death of me gon' be the Perkys
I know they laced pills, I bought them on purpose
Life's unreal when death's uncertain
It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse
I remember losing lil' bro, he laying in the dirt
Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
Good terms, bad terms, when they die, it's the worst
Sometimes when I'm high, I feel high in reverse
I ain't going out like that, you fuck with me, you get the work
You ain't gon' see me in no wooden box, I'm gonna shoot 'em first
I promise y'all I'm finna touch the world, yeah, I'ma touch the Earth
But hold on, your girl on my line, I think I may just fuck her first
Yeah, gotta have some crude humor
Just to keep a good vibe going, keep the song grooving
So all my money longer, shout out bro Uzi
Keep my eyes in the sky 'cause that's where I'm moving

Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find

Blind, blind, blind

This is dedicated to you if you felt the lowest of the low
I know how it feels, you don't wanna struggle anymore
Used to ball hard, ain't no triple-doubles anymore
Bitch, I'm talking 'bout my tears
Turned around and faced my fears
I haven't felt this low in years
We die in three like musketeers
Ain't too many real niggas left in here
R.I.P. to all my peers
Smoking loud pack, what you say? I can't hear
But I still hear the fallen ones in my ears
Why, why do we live to die, die?
When it's my time, time, time
I'll leave behind my end, my thirteen reasons why

Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find

Man of the year, still got problems
Lookin' in the mirror, you look awful
Talkin' to myself, do it too often
JK, Juice WRLD, you're so awesome
I'm running up funds
Bottle full of pills, let's have fun
No cheap thrills, only rich ones
Fire drills, hotter than the sun

I know I'm here to save you, I know I'm here to save you
Let's raise our hands and sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped your breakthrough

They say life's a puzzle, I'ma piece it together
But from the way I'm movin', I'll probably be piecing forever
I date a bad bitch, she'll be over decent forever
Even with fake tits, these other hoes just decent forever
My lady said she saw a baddie in the hotel lobby
Well, love, let's fuck her together
We got the world to our backs, give a fuck, never have
Middle fingers up, we're screamin', "Fuck 'em forever"

My ups and downs

In London town

The weight is heavy on my shoulders, girl, you're too much
You put my heart in a grave, I get no love
So I need more drugs, way too much
All I ever do is get fucked up
All I ever wanted was a real love
Got a pint of the lean, I done lucked up
Bros said that it wasn't real mud
Every day I wonder if I can pick my heart out my chest (Out my chest)
Lately I been feelin' the worst (Feelin' the worst)
So I gotta dress like the best (So I gotta dress like the best)
Moncler all on my chest (Moncler all on my chest)

I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
I'm not sure
(Yeah, I like that)
Uh

Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

I've been through the wringer
Tryna put a diamond ring on her finger
She love drama, she be watching Jerry Springer
Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no, I'm not a cheater
She hate it when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out or should I take her to the cleaner?
Love don't end good for me, no good for me
She's good for me, too good
These hoes love playing me, heartbreaking me
Don't pray for me, just give me drugs (Bring me drugs)

Just give me drugs
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs

Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

I told her, "Run around and get away"
I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout, I need to set another play
I need a umbrella 'cause every day feel like a rainy day
I need something other than Xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California, I'm tryna cut corners
Satan bossin' me around, but you know I don't take orders
Yeah, I had to move around, I was startin' to feel cornered
Startin' to feel cornered, I can't see the front door
Startin' to feel cornered, startin' to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screamin' out, "Why bother?"
My ex-bitch too bad, my next bitch way hotter
We met in a car crash, she ride it like full throttle

Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first
 
 
 
Uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, uh (Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

Swallow all these pills with my pride (Uh)
Married to my highs, you may kiss the bride
Trouble in my brain, see it in my eyes
I got voices in my head, they keep me up at night
Said I was okay, but I'm lying, feel like that I'm dying
Soul screaming and crying, feel my brain frying
Try to numb the pain, all the drugs I've been buying
This oxy gettin' pricey, pour the codeine in the Hi-C
Blood red blend in the Hi-C
I've been doing so much wrong, even though ma told me to do the right thing
Poppin' pills all night long, in the studio pourin' out my feelings
Can't explain this feeling
Kinda feels like I'm losing even though I'm winning

Drain out bad energy (Drain out bad energy)
Forget the bad memories (Forget the bad memories)
Drain out bad energy (Drain out bad energy)
Forget the bad memories (Forget the bad memories, ayy, ayy)

Multi-million dollars
All mine from the start
Codeine kills the drama
And the trauma in my heart
Just got a call from the dark side
Stab wounds in my chest, but I'm alright
I miss my friends, I hate this spotlight
I love my girl, I hate the thot life
Yellow diamonds, shiny pearls
I'm tryna give her the world
I'm tryna show her the world
She ain't no ordinary girl
I know she know, I know she know I'm down and out
Life is a ocean, demons I've been drownin' out
I watch the crowd and crack a smile
I have a job to lead them out

Drain out bad energy (Drain out bad energy)
Forget the bad memories (Forget the bad memories)
Drain out bad energy (Drain out bad energy)
Forget the bad memories (Forget the bad memories, drain, ayy)

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Daytrip took it to ten, hey)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
 
 
 
Vibe on this bitch, though
A lighter?
Nah, in the room
Oh
Uh-huh

You work numbers, work wonders
You done woke me up from my eternal slumber
I'm the lightning, you’re the thunder
There's a difference 'tween, "I need you," and, "I want you"
Girl, I need you
Good sex led to conversations getting a little deeper, uh
Tell me your darkest secrets, shit you wouldn’t even tell Jesus, uh
My karma been tweaking so much, I don't even believe in karma
But you give me a reason to thank God for all these recent falls
Percocet 30 E 8, I've been gettin' off
I done chilled out on the drugs since you've been involved
Suck it like it's love, fuck me like it's love
No protection on my heart, goddamnit, I'm gon’ hit it raw
Traumatized from my past, yeah, I keep a log
In my mind, in my head, where that shit belong
They say you after my bread, shit, I hope they wrong
You already ran up the bands, we could have a ball
Hit it from the back, humina, call a play, huddle up
This that good love in the bedroom
Fuck you in the Prada, poke her face like Lady Gaga
Ride it like a Mazda, zoom, zoom, zoom

I’m all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain’t that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see your light in all the darkness

Woah
'Atta boy, I done turned to a man
Hot chills when my skin is on your skin
Hope you know that if you ever try to end
You gon’ catch a couple out the F&N
That mean Cupid ain't give you a headshot
So I ain't got no choice but to leave you with a headshot
Look at the way I make that fucking bed rock, uh
Where your ring finger at? I need wedlock
Got my sights on your ass, ooh, red dot
We some bats that made it out of Hell, ooh, red hot
Don't, ayy, go all night, bitch, don't stop
We ain't even gon' be finished 'til the sun's up

I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way of giving compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins

Ain't that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in

Need a drink? (Hoo, ayy, ayy)
Found my home (Hoo, ooh, hoo, oh)
She make me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine...

Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it

There's love at my front door, short notice
She not like the sane girls, I noticed
Think I met my soulmate, yeah, I know it
When it gets dark outside, in you I confide
You help me face my demons, I won't hide, hide
Girls like you are hard to find
I hope you don't mind, if I give you the time of your life, life, life

Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it

Life is not the same with your pictures in my frame
Now that you're here, I want nothing to change
You pick me up when I'm down, I need you around
You seen me through my darkest times
Girl, is there something that you try to find?
You brought meaning to my life
All because of you, I do right
Because of you, I have a purpose
Fight for the world because you're worth it

Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it
 
 
 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression was in deception, you were lyin'

Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion

You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel

Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-ah

*exhaling*
Fell in love with your face off the shrooms
The way it animates your eyes in the room
I can see the stars when I'm gazing at you
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof, ooh
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb
I'm feeling over consumed
She walking me to my doom, I see her face in my room
When I'm alone in the room, I'ma blame that on the shrooms (Blame that on the shrooms)

Oh, feeling ridiculed, feeling like a fool, don't know what to do
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose

I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression was in deception, you were lyin'

Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion

I'm shittin' on these niggas, this is a excrement
I rapped on another beat that's some extra shit
You niggas gon' have to deal with the mess of it
I thought I told yo ass not to mess wit' it
I see this shit before I say it, telepathy
It's like I talk to my conscious, I say what it's tellin' me
Anything besides money, eh, it's kinda irrelevant
I can't focus without codeine, my medicine
I sip it until I'm slurrin' and spittin' impediments
I'm ballin' to the point where I think I need a Letterman
Westwood at the gates of London, he just had to let 'em in
I'm here, spazzin' on every single track he pass
You run up, I leave you leakin' on a maxi pad
I'm ballin', hard, these other niggas on the bench
I swear, they need to stay where they at
Nigga, I'm takin' over the world, a map for a map
I'm off of a ecstasy pill, that's a flat for a flat

Yo sins ain't forgivin'
I'm the rap God, call me Juice Allah
Did I take it too far?
Did I take two bars, to get on Mars?
To more like Dubai, hold on
I got a little tongue twisted, but I'm still gifted
Still spittin', still rippin' writtens
This premonition is really killin' it
And these niggas ain't shit
But Civics, me I'm Bentley
Get it, bitch
Don't you forget it
The shit that you talking, I really lived it, uh
I sold my soul then bought it back, I finessed 'em, uh
You run up on me, choppa holy it'll bless 'em, uh
He talking stupid 'til they shoot him, that's my weapon, uh
I got a couple of bars I could spit
Maybe I'll just use 'em in this shit
Or maybe I'll just use 'em in a skit
My first guess, they wanted shit
My next project, it's gon' be harder
My arm in the rim, really, I feel like Vince Carter
I'm at yo head nigga, I feel like a barber
You on the bench nigga, and I am a starter
I die for my shit nigga, feel like I'm a martyr
My shit's off the charts
You run up, that's okay, you catch a hole to your heart

All the legends, where they at? They all die
Well, I don't wanna be a legend up in my prime
But, I know it's still prime time
Stars, how I shine
When they align with the planet, you know some shit is goin' on
I transform like Omegatron, when my favorite song is on
Fuckin' that bitch like the Ramadan
Man, I spit shit

I'm never runnin' out of energy, I'm a suspect grippin' this firearm in your vicinity
Try me if you want, 'cause I swear it's not gon' end cool

Cock it back and then I shoot

Ayy, I flew from London to Chicago
Money in my pockets, I may get a Murciélago

Shout out to my kinfolk, they know I'm totin' ammo
In the streets they call me Rambo, ain't no peace where I'm from
But these pieces, we tote 'em, you run up on me it's over
Like a cig, we gon' smoke 'em
I put yo ass in a coma
Smokin' kush, this aroma, leave yo ass in a coma
Ballin' out like I'm Odom before the crack, don't you get it?
Spittin' crack on these niggas, define niggas like physics
Shut the fuck up and listen, I'm ballin' hard like a Piston
Nigga this shit's enlisted just like a army lil' nigga
I swear to god I'm invincible you can't harm me lil' nigga, yeah

Outer space I'm ballin' like I'm shootin' up on Pluto
Talkin' stupid to me 'til I pull up let the tool blow
Emperor new school, call me Juice Kuzco
Known to flip this shit and kick it like I'm knowing Judo
That's just how it goes though
If I touch the world I told you that shit is a snow globe
That's just how my flow is
Living in the moment
Your bitch swallow my kids

I can break it down, a million different phrases
Look at all my songs on the playlist

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me
Ex-girlfriend keeps calling my phone

DY definitely Krazy

Abandon all ships, it's about to go down
No Titanic (Titanic)
There's a lot going on in my head right now
But I manage (Yeah, I manage)
Good heart, good soul, both been in bad hands
I could deal damage (Yeah, real damage)
Both hands in the air as I scream out prayers
My demons show their face in the midnight air

Just got a new house, gotta hide the skeletons in the closet
And keep 'em there, really tryna forget about 'em
They tell me God watchin' over me, I don't doubt it
But I can see Him gettin' tired of me sinnin' and wildin'
Don't know what to do with myself these days
Young rich nigga, I done fell in love with the bank
But all this money don't rid me of my pain
But everywhere I go, I could make it precipitate, rain

Fucked up (Fucked up), I did (I did)
Fucked up (Fucked up), I am (I am)
Calm down, I can't
Shit, here we go again

Abandon all ships, it's about to go down
No Titanic (Titanic)
There's a lot going on in my head right now
But I manage (Yeah, I manage)
Good heart, good soul, both been in bad hands
I could deal damage (Yeah, real damage)
Both hands in the air as I scream out prayers
My demons show their face in the midnight air

Set sail in the codeine bottle, I'ma drown in it, drown in it
Shit fills me up, but whatever goes up goes down in it, down in it
At the end of the day, I'm blessed, oh yes, crack a smile with it, smile with it
Now I'm frownin' again, life goes so fast, watch it blow in the wind
Can't get time back, I been beggin' for it

Fucked up (Fucked up), I did
Oh, fucked up, I am
Here we go again (Here we go again)

Abandon all ships, it's about to go down
No Titanic (Titanic)
There's a lot going on in my head right now
But I manage (Yeah, I manage)
Good heart, good soul, both been in bad hands
I could deal damage (Yeah, real damage)
Both hands in the air as I scream out prayers
My demons show their face in the midnight air

Midnight air, midnight air
Midnight air (Midnight air), I'ma drown in here
Midnight air (Midnight air), surrounded in the midnight air
I'ma drown in here, no Titanic, Titanic
Man, fuck

Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life

Man you know what, y-you're right…
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

I ain't been gettin' high
Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin',
 
get 'em so wet they need coasters (Facts)
I got a selfie with Oprah (Facts), I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted
I ain't frowned since '06, I ain't cried since '01
My pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I

She said she 21, I might have to ID that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screenin' out the lane
Went from "Damn, this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I

He should be happy I'm giving you back
'Cause I can make you wifey for a week
We can spend a weekend in Japan
If anyone fuck with my akachan
Tell em' they'll get fucking Jackie Chan-ed
Honestly I'm better as your boy
I'd be kinda shitty as your man
Let's go back to only being friends
Sorry girl I hope you understand

It's just that
I don't want to fall in love (No, no) (Nope)
Love cuts just like a knife (That's right)
You make the knife feel good (Baby) (So good, so good)
I’ll fight you 'til the end (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I don't want to fall in love (No, no) (Nah, haha)

I wasn't leading you on girl (No, no)
I just forgot where I was goin'
I got way too attached (Baby)
That wasn't the plan
And I knew a girl just like you once (You once)
We ended up hating each other
'Cause we couldn't let it end (No, no)
That can’t happen again, no

I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)

Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end

Someone put em up ding-ding-ding
Pulling on my heart strings zing-zing-zing
But I’m trying to let go
But it's hard enough to leave you alone
With the phone goin' ring ring ring
Please let me go
'Cause I don’t want to fall in love
'Cause the last time left me cold
When she left my house, she didn’t even let me know
Nigga she ain’t even leave me notes
Part of the reason I’m easily hurt
Part of the reason I’m leaving you first
Pardon that, part of me give my apologies
I know that working on it never works
And I’m sorry it’s you, but hey what should I do?
Be happy with lies? Or be sad with the truth?
Don’t be ashamed you see love is a game and I still want to play
I’m just too scared to lose and I know you are too

I don’t wanna fall in love (No, no)
(But it's, it's good, you know?)
Love cuts just like a knife
(I mean we're young, we don't need to be all tied down)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
(Yo, yo,  honestly fuck this shit, um, yo let's just boogie, alright?)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end

And if like, I'm fuckin' great
I mean like, what else could they be?

But its filled with all this shit about
Spots you've never been

You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say

Well hey girl, it's so insane girl
I'm so in love with all of the things you say girl
But hey girl I know this is like sorta like crazy
But if I could, and you could, then we could, like maybe
Surpass expectations and give a demonstration
Of a committed relation to our loveless generation
And if you do, you can be mine
And if you don't it's totally fine, I'll just accept that I'm a dweeb
Proceed to go home in my room and cry
I'll close the door and I'll ignore the fact you're into other guys
And I'll wash away the pain with a million tears I cry
But if you do (nah), oh baby if you do
I would like to give my entire life to you

You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say

Hey, wait, hold on, wait
Okay, let me fucking say what I have to fucking say
See I think that you're great, and a gift given from God
Now I believe that God is love and my love is what you are
And you know that it's true, and as pretty as you are
Focusin' on every flaw, every wrinkle, every scar
And everything that you aren't
And the prettiest thing of all is that your nose is not fake
And your boobs are no facade
Baby, you truly are just everything that you are
And that's perfect
Because a silicon soul and a polyester heart
Makes the light inside kinda dark, yeah

You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say

Yeah, okay well hey yo remember me?
The one you used to rarely meet
Yeah I was just on BET, didn't see? No?
Just something I thought about
Probably happy you know a lot of kids that you fucked off and forgot about
But not this, not what this all about
There is more than that to it
Look I know we've both been through it but
You've been doing anything but what you should be doing like
When I call you on Christmas and you come with excuses
And tell me how you're sorry Kyle but this year I'm Jewish
But last year you was Hindu, and the year before was Buddhist
To keep from buying me clothes, I bet you'll probably be a nudist huh?
Probably have my moms on Maury, asking them to prove it
So I put my face on albums so you'd have to face the music
And when I think about it, it couldn't have been that hard
I didn't need the money man, I just wanted the card
But you was always busy or like somewhere hella far
And ever since I made it, it seems like you never are
That's weird

I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory

August 24th, 2013 Journal entry 87
The past is just a story we tell ourselves
Do you remember ours?
Tell me the story would you please?

Yeah, hey look the happy rapper's not so happy now
I remember when I used to laugh out loud
Nowadays I only LOL
Through text cause I don't wanna talk
Don't touch me I don't wanna feel
Rewrote this verse a couple times
First time I kept it way too real
Back before droppin "Keep It Real"
You really dropped me on my ass
I sent a hundred thousand text's
Don't think you ever sent one back
Let's backtrack back to twenty twelve
Packed our backpacks and hit the road
Felt like I died and went to heaven
My life at home was living hell
I told you, you was all I had
It's funny then you couldn't tell
When all your friends was talking shit
It's funny then you couldn't smell
It's funny then you couldn't spell
When I got no answers to those texts
These things get harder to forgive, and even harder to forget
But when I think about it, I'm kinda glad that you did
Don't try to eat with me now
You couldn't starve with me then
A couple months ago fuck
It was hard for us to be friends
Your heart is so much bigger ever since I made it big
Man that's weird

I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
 
 
 
Mhm, oh yeah, gratata
This is a real ass problem and it should be taken seriously, ok?

So uhm ay, listen bae
Since you’ve been dating your phone all day
Why don’t you come back down to Earth
You spend too much time in cyberspace
Ok, ok, ok this shit’s lame
FaceTime's the only way I get laid
So get off your phone or leave me alone
Yeah, that would be great

Baby, do me just one thing
Put that phone down and look at me
I wanna love you but you’d rather tweet
I wanna love you but you’d rather love that screen
Never have I been so green
But how can I be jealous of this scene
I got a man who would never leave
But when he's here, no, he's not with me

Baby girl, you’re bigger than the Instagram
You know that I’m your biggest fan
You're so something to show the pictures can't

You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know it's so much bigger babe

So, uhm, I feel like I can see your soul
When I’m with you I feel like I’m 3 years old you know
But the moment you grabbed your phone
It's like I start knocking and no one's home
It's like I start calling and no one's there
I guess if it ain't got likes no one cares
Don’t follow me, walk with me (Damn)
Don’t tweet to me, talk to me (Yeah)
Retweets that don’t mean shit, they say they heart you but not like this
Yeah, you got favorites you ain't they favorite
Oh my bad, did you forget?
All those people on your Facebook page, are not your only friends
I wanna dive into your heart baby, not slide in your dms

Baby girl, you’re bigger than the Instagram
You know that I’m your biggest fan
You're so something to show the pictures can't

You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know it's so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us

If it’s all the same your boyfriend is so- so
Why does he complain with a girl that’s so oh whoa!

And I know you out there looking for love and that’s alright
I hear you telling all of your friends I’m not your type
But let’s be honest girl there’s no point to lie
'Cause it’s raining love and we gon' turn it up for one night

Nights like this I wish that the rain would fall
We could be the storm with one kiss is all

It's raining love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
It's raining love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

One time for the girls in the sweaters
Who do everything better than our exes, right
Two times for the girls with the curls
And an ass like they got down in Texas, 'ight
Had me like "damn," when I seen your face
Made me forget what I had to say
We might as well get a room for a week
'Cause damn girl you done got ass for days
And I don't even drink, I bought the liquor for you
And I don't even fight, I'll hit that nigga for you
Like for really, I'm not the nigga to lie
Like a polygraph, all I know is the truth
And the truth is all that college is useless
'Cause your brain's amazing, but that ass stupid
Me and you could do things, I don't usually do this
I'mma take you higher than my condo roof is
Yeah

And I know you out there looking for love and that’s alright
I hear you telling all of your friends I’m not your type
But let’s be honest girl there’s no point to lie
'Cause it’s raining love and we gon' turn it up for one night

Nights like this I wish that the rain would fall
We could be the storm with one kiss is all

It's raining love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
It's raining love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

Does anyone know? Anyone know at all?
Where did our good times go
Four years of snow ever since you've been gone
We've been a frozen
Oh whoa, credible cold chillin' my soul, oh dee-oh-doe
Oh no, need you don't go feel so alone, oh dee-oh-doe

You tell me one day the world's gon' need you
And that's might bring you to your knees
Sun is falling, and it's your calling
That you're a star but you can see
Don't lose sight there, there's a light there
And I'll be right there when you need
I'm here to save y'all, please just pray y'all on my way y'all

Need you all to just wait on me
I need you to wait on me
Need you to wait on me
Please can you wait on, wait on, wait on me?
I need y'all to wait on me
I need you to wait on me
Please can you wait on, wait on

Trying to break the mold here, keep from growing old here
Closet full of jackets yeah it sucks it always snows here
Living rooms are froze here, you can fucking ice skate
And everybody knows here that nobody should go here
Don't come here, it's bad here
I remember last year, never home, shattered phone
Breaking hella glass here
Damn that was a fast year
Should've got my heart a fuckin' cast year
I'm jumpy cause I'm haunted by past year
And post traumatic past fears
Super duper sad here
Wish I went to church now
Wish I had my gramps here
Really need my dad here
Memories of weeks with the lights off
So now I always keep a fucking lamp near
I'm weird but I'm trying man, I'm motherfuckin' trying
I'm tryna get through this verse without me fucking crying
Suck it up, "You gotta be a man, gotta take care of your fam"
That's what he was saying right before he died

You tell me one day the worlds gon' need you
And that's might bring you to your knees
Sun is falling, and it's your calling
That you're a star but you can see
Don't lose sight there, there's a light there
And I'll be right there when you need
I'm here to save y'all, please just pray y'all on my way y'all

Need you all to just wait on me
I need you to wait on me
Need you to wait on me
Please can you wait on, wait on, wait on me?
I need y'all to wait on me
I need you to wait on me
Please can you wait on, wait on
 
 
 
Tell me why I feels no test
Never been to church but I feel so blessed
Niggas told me no, but I feel so yes
Told em' nigga I, nigga I don't need yo' stress
Nigga I, nigga I don't need yo' stress
I'ma do me I don't need your steps
They can all talk, I already know
One day I'ma glow, glow, glow, glow

Woah, waiting on the showtime (Lights, lights)
It's me on my own time (Right, right)
They're waiting on the sunrise (It's night, night)
And I'ma be the one to, to shine

On the road to glory
People come and people go
Why should I feel sorry
That I was fast and they were slow
Misunderstood but it's all good
Enjoy my view from Hollywood
And if that's what they call me
It's all good, I'm Hollywood
Yep, yep, yep, enjoy my view from Hollywood
Yep, yep, yep, enjoy my view from Hollywood
Yep, yep, yep, enjoy my view from Hollywood
Yep, yep, yep enjoy my view from Hollywood

Walking through the city
Foggy nights and lonely streets
Looking for somebody
But no one remembers me
I tried calling all my friends
They turned off their phones again
If the top is lonely
Well then, lonely's where I'll be
Making them hate me but I've never hated them
Always been focused on making a way for them
I spend a third of my nights trying to pray for them
But they can't hear it 'cause I'm far away from them
Hope that they're happy, I'm fucking ashamed again
My life's surrounded by sadness and pain again
I'm starting to drink that shit by the case again
Made it hard for me to face my own face again

Woah, waiting on the showtime, yeah (Lights, lights)
Woah, it's me on my own time (Right, right)
Woah, they're waiting on the sunrise (It's night, night)
Woah, and I'ma be the one to, to shine

On the road to glory
People come and people go
Why should I feel sorry
That I was fast and they were slow?
Misunderstood but it's all good
Enjoy my view from Hollywood
And if that's what they call me
It's all good, I'm Hollywood
Yep, yep, yep, enjoy my view from Hollywood
Yep, yep, yep, enjoy my view from Hollywood
Yep, yep, yep, enjoy my view from Hollywood
Yep, yep, yep enjoy my view from Hollywood

Hop in the coupe and I'm swerving lanes
No new friends, I'm curvin' lames
My niggas solid, stay the same

Going to work, got no time to waste
Takin' my time, I ain't trying to race
I'ma stay all on my grind
Stackin' my G's to the sky
Rollin' that weed with my guys

This feel like my chance

Hey KYLE!

Hey, yo, you're KYLE
Heard you brought nice niggas back in style
Funny how your teeth are all fucked on fleek
And you're still going to teach the whole world to smile (Right?)
I mean it's pretty much the plan
Flavor that you niggas bring, pretty fucking bland
I be hopping on these tracks like I'm pretty much the man
And I probably feel the way cause I pretty much am, damn
Being anything but lazy
Making these crowds go fucking crazy
Practice backflips on these stages
Give everybody in the front row rabies (Real)
"Kyle, yeah that's my baby"
Everyday feels like I fucking made it
Young King Wavy from California
Women look 23 when they 80 (Ew)
Let's move in a castle
You stop dating these assholes

Damn, man, that's real cool
I knew I wasn't gonna really need school
She like me, nigga not you
You're some guy and I'm that dude, dude
Niggas didn't think it was true
They thought my wishes would never come true
They thought I'd end up like all of my friends
Selling narcotics to pay for my food
Haha nah, sorry, no
I don't need dope to feel like gold
So lets be high, and they'll be low
And we'll be good babe, the sun is up, yeah

Shawty swing my way

Cloudy days don't ever bother me
Hating niggas never go to sleep
Busy trying to keep me up awake
Trying to keep a young'n from his dreams

Beat me in a battle? Nigga please
Uh huh, um yeah, uh shout out to Jesus
And uh, shout out to Jesus and Jesus

Yeah, I make it DewWutItDoez
These niggas do it but don't do it good
These niggas do this shit just for the funds
I go the hardest dude just for the fun
Yeah, shout out to Zini the man
I specialize in doing what niggas can't
Even when I was a young'n in class I always went harder than all my friends
Shout out to niggas who said I was wack
Couple years later they're all on my sack
Wanting to feature me all on these tracks
Send me a text I do not send em back
Biggidy backity fuckity up
People around me will prove you ain't tough
I'm telling you I've seen this venue before
Believe me the same one you bitch niggas want
SuperDuper do this all for the love
And that's why these girlies just can't get enough
And that's why you rappers just can't get a break
A house with no outlets, you can't get the plug
Damn, someone should tell them to stop
Just cause I'm popping they tell me I'm Pop
And all of they girlfriends' tell me I'm hot
Just cause they not me they tell me I'm not
That's no no don't you know that you're wrong?
And I'm the one writing your favorite songs?
From all of your favorite rappers don't act like if I wasn't here they wouldn't all be gone
Gone is for sure, gone with the wind
They say they gonna pass me up, gosh nigga when?
It's taking too long, way too fucking long
The only one who likes your raps is your mom
But we both know that she been singing mine more
You're on the internet, not in the stores
I'm on the bed now moved up from the couch
I remember when I slept on the floor
And so did my sister, and so did my bro
And we had to go to Fallas for the clothes
The way I was swagging was so damn on point
I couldn't even tell that I was broke

Yeah man uh you know shout out to Jesus
I wanna thank Jesus one time
Shout out to my nigga Jesus on the couch
You know what I'm saying?
Shout out to muhfucking Jesus
Shout out to my homie Jesus over there chilling
Yeah, shout out to Jesus rolling that blunt
And shout out to Zini and Jesus

Shout out to the young man Brick
He's 17 chilling on some grown man shit
Man we got a lot of hands if somebody wanna trip
Sleep more broke niggas than a Motel 6
I make it do what it do
And I did it 'for niggas thought it was cool
Swear this shits like I just do something once
And all of you niggas start doing it too
And I don't get the debit or the cred what's up bruh?
Kurt Angle theme song you suck bruh
Did a couple shows putting on for the turf
Now me and Sean trade verses on Surf
Fake niggas don't look right at me
The way your bitch just threw it at me I nicknamed her nerf
And do not speak directly at me
If you wanna say something, @ me, that actually works
Your hating ass actions don't actually work
I just act like they do they don't actually hurt
You don't have half of fictional racks from your raps yo that's not what you're actually worth
The planet you're on isn't actually earth
If you think your girlfriend can actually twerk
The funniest thing is the laziest part of your brain is the section that actually works
Yo that would suck, if I was you, good thing I'm not
Your moms a thot, I- Brick thinks she's hot, I'm pretty sure they fucked yo this is awk
Dude, cool, it happens to the best of us
If you fuck with one of us you gotta squab the rest of us
Already had the rap life that was in a past life
I had to come back because I wasn't the best of them
Didn't cash checks enough
Didn't curve my ex enough
Didn't have one night stand drunk sex enough
Didn't knock niggas out, niggas didn't test enough
Itching for the hands, do you have eczema?
Last album I ain't really beat my chest enough
Got these rappers running, I know they can hear me catching up
Super Duper flexing up until there ain't any left of us
You do whatever the fuck you want and I'll do what it fucking does
Yeah

Yo that was easy
Uh, first and foremost I wanna give a big shout out to Jesus
And our sponsors over at, uh, Jesus Incorporated
Uh yo, I wanna, uh, shout out to everybody at Super Duper
Especially my nigga Jesus, you know what I mean?
Uh, I got a homie serving life right now, he go by the name of J-Dog
Or Jesus, you can call him that too, shout out to him
And uh I'm trying to think, I'm trying to think who else do I shout out
(Shout out Jesus, shout out Jesus)
You're right, right, okay
Yo shout out, uh, to my boy Jesus, and shout out to my mom and Jesus

You and me will always be tight

Even when you starts acting like a fool
You know I'm loving every single thing you do


Fuckin' you made me proud of me
'Cause I know that you doubted me
Even told me I would never get wit' ya
Told me I could never get wit' ya
But this pride in me
Wouldn't let you slide by me
That's when I came back 'round
I played my game with no respect, I finessed ya to make me seem down but
I finessed ya, it was all a stresser
I was your nigga, messed up, fucked your head up
Shoulda never came 'round
You let me in and I let you down
I was wrong 'cause I fucked up the game, baby
Your name crazy in the streets, got 'em sayin' things
My pride was the cause of it all
I apologize for the flaws in it all, wrongs in it all, 'cause

You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
I know my pride, ain't always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you

Baby, I shoulda listened when you told me
I would do better as a homie, yeah
Right there, I shoulda took a note
But pride was buggin' on me
I shouldn't, I shouldn't make excuses now
'Cause I know that it's useless now
You know what the truth is now
You swear you know how I do shit now
So I'll be gone 'til November
Talkin' old Timberlands in the winter
With this .5 on my side and my .40
You moved on but you still are my shawty
I don't wanna lie because I'm right wit' ya
You always pick me up, I don't get ya
I been tryna find your heart, I'm still tryin'
You can find someone else but you're still mine, 'cause

You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
Know my pride, ain't always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you

It's one of the crazier stories we’ve heard of, guys (I know)
As it's unfolding it's like—Fuck Tory Lanez, okay? Now, I’m from Houston, and he's from, bro
And to think that the whole night unfolded on social media
You are the alleged shooter of Megan Thee Stallion
Instagram, in the pool with Kylie Jenner
Was she backtracking with what she said originally?
You know, maybe that's why we don't have a report
Donkey of the day
Some bitches tryna  take up for Tory and, "It's more to the story," bitch, it ain't-there ain't nothing to the story
Tory Lanez got a lot of bad press
Serious, he's gon’ get deported
Donkey of the day for Friday August 21st goes to Daystar Peterson
So they got pulled over and she had been shot already, great
Well, hold up—
Donkey of the Day
What I’m looking like, he looking at the police and then shot her?
Niggas like that, you a sucker, he's the king sucker, he’s the-he's the biggest sucker in the industry (Facts)
We gotta talk about Tory Lanez and Megan Thee Stallion
Kaash is looking for you, dawg
Because the police came out saying, "We didn't even know she was shot"
Guess who I believe? Megan
The best thing for Tory Lanez is for real, he needs to just begone

I'm done with this, you gotta know the truth

Ayy, they rather see me in the cell
Like how he posted out with thirty thousand dollar bail?
I’m the GOAT, y'all niggas know I made that dope float on the scale
I had them hoes goin' crazy, fiends crackin', goin' pale
They know I'm real, I got that flow, it's on sale if you need a rush
Coke blowin' out my fiend's nose like the speaker bus
Ho caught me D'd up, talk down, we T'ing up
Megan people tryna frame me for a shootin'
But them boys ain't clean enough
I see how they teamin' up, watchin' and I'm calculatin'
Gotta keep it quiet, I can't jeopardize the outcome waitin'
Seein' certain niggas hatin', like, how this nigga hatin'?
I done gave these people so much features, made these niggas famous
They was on the blog sayin' I'm canceled from this entertainment
I was on that Spotify like thirty million monthly listeners, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy
And my fans support me brazy, everythin' I do is for you, I promise I'll be on it daily
I got nothin' but love to spread, but niggas hate me
Hurt my heart to see them Twitter fingers come from Kehlani's and Kaash Paige's
But I flipped the switch, I'm grippin' money at that fast pace
And don't ask me for shit when it get real, that's my last favor
Can't cry now 'cause I'ma laugh later
Girl, you had the nerve to write that statement on that affidavit
Knowin' I ain't do it but I'm comin' at my truest
Tryna keep this shit two hunnid with you, shorty, I can prove it
But them people in yo ear, they the true ones that I fear
They really got you thinkin' Tory Lanez would do you in, for real
Don't forget you was my bitch, I held it down and kept it real
I would never paint no fake picture of you just for some mills
And I thought that you was solid too, but look at how you doin' me
Look at how you doin' me, people tryna ruin me
And what's even worse is I'm still thinkin' about you and me
How you goin' live my birthday with all your jewelry to try to make some fool of me?
But I love you hard so I'm gon' cool it, B
'Cause I was coolin' right with Cuban, B, that was a stupid me
Somehow I'm still down to renegotiate the unity
My heart in some foolery, this shit is just confusin' me
I'm goin' through these phases, but I gotta stack that paper
And the real estate niggas hatin', took me off that application
But when they took that from me, they really took that from my baby
What the fuck I'm finna say to his old lady?
What the fuck y'all mean, my son don't need a house?
My baby momma don't need safety?
And even though I got the payment, the real estate niggas still hatin'
'Cause he watchin' me all on the news, but I ain't charged with no cases
Say the owner say my case is lookin' crazy, how the fuck that even make sense?
New times turn to past tense
All I want is straight cash, niggas say I lack sense
Star player, hearin' lies comin' from the back bench
Kill or be killed, that's the reason I don't have friends
Niggas lyin' on the crodie, niggas sayin' I'm deported
Oh, now I'm 5'3"? Niggas sayin' I'm a shorty
But lil' bitch I'm 5'7", money on me side-steppin'
And if I stand on my wallet, you can see my thighs in Heaven
One Umbrella gang and when we come back, don't you try reppin'
'Fore I let these niggas breathe, I gotta teach a couple lessons
Gotta see a couple questions: how the fuck you get shot in your foot, don't hit no bones or tendons?
How the fuck your team is tryna to paint me as some whole menace?
I just lost like ten million dollars because this cold business
But I got like ten million followers that's gon' roll with me
Fans that support me 'cause they know my heart
So I don't give a damn if shorty know Jigga
I was taught to beat the block
Eeny, meeny, miney in these streets, and so my Nina cocked
Niggas, y'all can play me, y'all can frame me, but I'ma reach the top
I would never put you in no danger, and if I did, you would've said it when you seen the cops
Ayy, Lamborghini bands and they comin' out the floor
Fff, hit the fan when I'm pullin' out the dough-oh
I would never fall out with niggas over hoes, ayy
Money over fall outs, my nigga, that's the code-oh
Santorini bands when I pull up to the coast
Better have my bands when I pull up to the door-oh
Niggas can't believe I done pulled up in a Ghost
And I don't ever wanna fuck with y'all no more, G
I got bad bitches tryna have a orgy
Keep umbrellas for the days it get stormy
I pour the Henny for my niggas, that's before me
My outfit fly, you gotta seat out by the floor seats
She tatted me all on her face 'cause she adore me
They talkin' petty 'bout me but they lookin' corny
I had to fight for mine, nigga, you were sworn in
And God bless me when I wake up every mornin'
 
 
 
Yeah, look
2006, these niggas hated
But I told them I would make it from the bottom
Look, I made this shit possible, baby, I'm back on the shits
My baby looked at me like, "damn it, I hate when you back on the shits"
Looked at it like this
I-I-I gotta stack it and flip
Yeah, this my Fargo shit man
I go, I go missin' for a month and this is what you do

Wait, I'ma take y'all way back, way, way back
Before the old school, before the Maybach
Whoever came back
And put the  Maple Leaf on the Jays hat
I was on court chillin' with my niggas
On the corner fuckin' with the felons
Wishin' for the Honda Civic
Pacin', smokin' outta staircases in the ceilin'
Dawg, I just want a new job
Want my old girl to get a boob job
Want my new girl to get a new job
Yellin', "2Pac, 2Pac, 2Pac"
Two Glocks strapped all up on my waist
For any nigga trippin' around my way
Mini Mac, strapped for haters in the back
In this mini black JanSport backpack
Nigga, matter fact, uh
Rollin' blunts with my nigga Rocky
All we do is go, all we do is go, all we do is go

Couple bitches that go hand in head

Women love me like I'm on the Ellen show
Hella bars for my felon flow
Niggas hella hard hearin' blind to 'em
Gotta hit 'em with that Helen Keller flow
I fucked a lot of bitches, Lord forgive me
Father God, know I did a lot of sinnin'
Now, I'm watchin' every one of my decisions
'Cause I know the fact that even though I’m livin’
Nigga livin’ under 'only God conditions'
So in my position
Gotta mob on the competition
Gotta squab on the opposition

His jewelry, wack, his foot stance, wack
The way that he talks, wack
The way that he doesn't even like to smile, wack
Me, I'm tight as fuck
Look

All I'm catchin' is niggas on Twitter, dissin'
And talkin' lies on they lives
I cannot recognize my ex-twin in full disguise
Since I went independent, these niggas want my demise
But I am yeast to the bread, my nigga, watch me rise
I'm watchin' niggas analyze me, how you protectin' me?
But made this whole plan to fry me?
Since the event, you never called me but you can't deny me
If you got shot from behind, how can you identify me?
It's funny how you got these lil' fufu, four plaque, lil' ju-ju niggas
 
talkin' Zulu
I coulda made the shooters make a movie like it's Hulu
But who's these new niggas, talkin', boppin' and poppin' shit
But got less than four accomplishments? I got way more to lose than you do
Uh, watchin' the industry try and ho you
Asian Doll talkin', but shawty, I don't know you
I never met you, nor have I heard a song
And nor have I seen billboards
See your name in any cert or song from out your catalog
Oop, the hat is off
Behind that tatted skin, you battered with scattered scars
But I still respect and help you
Just don't treat me like you see me out in public
And I said, "Fuck it," and tried to disrespect you
JoJo, that was a bozo move
You tryna take me off a song that got you the most views
Got mad love for you, though, your label, they confused
They spent fifty on my feature, they fifty K in the lose right now, yeah
Nigga, play me, nigga, play me 'til the day I get to save me
I'm watchin' mad face and y'all niggas is movin' shady
Delusional, like
Like how that 1942 from Kylie house still got you talkin' crazy
Fuck a hail or handshake from niggas
The past months, the energy been mad fake from niggas
But I'm lifted up, bring Saran Wrap, talents gifted up
And if I drop this shit for a second, I'm back to pick it up
Unapologetically, jumped inside a pool and Kylie's face was lookin' heavenly
And though I'm innocent, they got this picture painted heavily
I pray that God remember me, faith done turn all my situations to a melon tree
Uh, J.R. Smith, it's the pot that piss
And you the last cat that should talk about some shots that hit
'Cause your performance and percentage, player
Rollin', ridin' benches, nigga, I'm from the trenches, nigga
You the type to buy a chick a eighty inch and still won't get a inch up in her
Yeah, I'm at they head, sprayin' hard like a spritzer, nigga
Baggin' niggas' ex bitches off a Insta' picture
Toes rufflin' through the sand like a Kingston nigga
Yeah, contradictions in your lines
With domestic pride crimes, we still have yet to find mines
Any time I brought these bitches up, you stressed it five times
How you try to kill the cat and then forget them nine lives?
I know it so well, I know these niggas so well
Jealous feelings, niggas best at catchin' like they Odell
It's rap niggas out here tellin' Megan she should go tell
But she won't tell the truth 'cause I'll be kicked up in my hotel
When the spiteful live shiesty, it's real trife
You niggas playin' Instagram, I'm playin' real life
Think I'm finna talk about a open case just for some likes?
I promise we done worked too many nights
Please, talkin' nights, we worked on a wage, flippin', turn through the page
We got Bun B on live sayin' I should burn in a cage
In these times of Black lives, he sayin' I should turn to a slave
If 
C pmiP
 heard that, then my nigga would have a rage right now
No diss to Pimp and Bun, but you made "Big Pimpin'," son
Pourin' champagne on women faces while they flick they tongue
I'm too young to give you lessons, but I'd like to give you one
Please stay the fuck up out my case, I ain't convicted, son
Chance the Rapp.. (Mmm, mmm), too irrelevant
I replaced his line with, "My chain lookin' Heaven-sent"
Next line, next line, 'cause momma always told me, "Don't you chew that food unless you would eat that shit for a next time"
I made too much money with Roc Nation
For niggas to be thinkin' I can't correlate the fact that it's only niggas out your roster hatin'
Contemplatin' these thoughts in my head
Like, 
"How the fuck these niggas callin' me, threatenin' me not to make no statements?"
Huh, the nerve nowadays
I'm hittin' certain niggas with the swerve nowadays
Gimme one DreamDoll hit record (Mmm), I'll wait
Ayy, Masika, this your chance, you in every Twitter debate
And every Shade Room comment like common sense ain't common sense
Like we be needin' your two cents and all your vents
Fakin' a kidnappin' for your OnlyFans
And tryna front like missin' kids was your intent
If that's the type of shit you teachin' Khari, then you should sit in a pen'
And watch people disagree in the end
You try to make it facts, but it's a L-I-E in the end
Oh, it ain't funny when it's your turn
When spectators got they lighters out with gasoline and wantin' yo' burn
Fuck a caption, this is facts with no cappin'
When Michael Jackson, Prince got they masters back, what happened?
Tory Lanez got his masters back just now and look what happened?
And Chris Brown, a Black man that changed his life for the right
And still, Black Twitter findin' ways to tear him down and bring him back in
A rapper catch a domestic
, y'all start to talk that action
I feel like Famous Amos after all that happened
They want the downfall of every Black man, but I ain't goin'

They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop
They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop
It's like, it's like, you gotta take into account
Most of these niggas got my number, like
You coulda called me, like
You know what I'm sayin', like
In the most sincere way, you coulda asked, like, nigga, like, "What happened? Did you do it?"
You know, even that woulda been straight to me, you know what I'm sayin', like
I guess I'm just different
But it's all good, nigga, I'ma continue to shine
You niggas could never stop me, nigga
You'll never put my back against the motherfuckin' wall, nigga
As long as my toes in the sand on God's green Earth, nigga
I wear the crown, shinin' notoriously and gloriously
I'm on a whole 'nother set of time, nigga, Super Saiyan five, nigga
Come out swingin', like Broly, you niggas'll never stop me, nigga
'Cause every time y'all niggas throw somethin' at me, nigga
I just keep risin', I never stop, I never back down, nigga
Back to the wall, I stand tall, nigga
Forever Umbrella, uh, uh, Tory, 
Canada
They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop
They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop

Snakehips

I tell all Spanish bitches, "dímelo"
She say it's for her and not for me to know
She always wanna know why I don't let her roll
So shit, just say for you it's just for me to know
I said the faces in my Rollie never tick tock
Stacking paper 'til it's at the tip top (Tip it)
I know why they mad, 'cause my shit pop
Driving to success so fuck a pit stop
Swear I did it all for some Adidas
I'm the one that said fuck any non-believers
Homeboy, I know you love to think you fucking wit' me
Just keep it real my G, who really run the city?
Fargo got 'em bunch of bitches in the Caravan
Step off in your bitches like a pair of Vans
Damn this white bitch with me look like Marilyn
My life just like a movie that could never end

And it's all in one night, since everyone around
We brought everyone up out of their home for one night
So let's get right

I got Hispanic bitches yelling dímelo
I'm the one that's living shit la vida loca
Toastin' to my niggas 'cause we finally made it
Crazy, we did everything we dreamed of

I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Put your hands up if you deserve it
I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Put your hands up if you deserve it

Tell them niggas drop a O in a ziplock
Tell the competition, wait
I forgot, no competition, I got shit locked
I got big plans for some big guap
Girl, these niggas sayin I'll be rich
I been plotting on that shit since '96
If I go reaching for a fail, I'll probably miss
The realest song up of the year is probably this
I see these niggas talk so down 'bout a nigga, man
But you know that I'm rich and I don't give a damn
I'm ridin' 'round the town in that 911
And she say she don't want this shit to ever end

And it's all in one night, since everyone around
We brought everyone up out of their home for one night
So let's get right

I got Hispanic bitches yelling dímelo
I'm the one that's living shit la vida loca
Toasting to my niggas 'cause we finally made it
Crazy, we did everything we dreamed of

I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Put your hands up if you deserve it
I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Put your hands up if you deserve it

To kill a backpack nigga with his Jansport on
Geek ass nigga

Pull the heat fast and blast

Out to Massachusetts, catch this nigga slipping in his hometown

Coupe deploy ya, label drop ya, who's the lawyer?

Oops, I'm going, who's condoning? Juice and jonesing

Tryna ask this pussy ass nigga who the fuck want smoke
But the lightskin niggas in ya crew too spooked to join in
I'm a nasty nigga, then you could ask these nigga
The shotty dumping popping up outta the backseat, nigga

I tax these niggas, get at these niggas, attack these niggas
The venom is arachne, nigga
I'm 'bout kill da man and da man that done backed these niggas
And blam any man that'll try to dap you niggas
And clap any stan fan that attract you niggas
See ya daddy was a musician that never made  it
'Cause when you was born nigga it was you or him
Shattered knowing he would never make it as an artist
And the odds of his life prolly be 2 to 1
But I give it to him 'cause he didn't run
I guess he figured, "man when you look at it in a nutshell
All I got is a failed music career and
My revenge is giving that shit to my son"
Nigga I'ma flossy nigga
They try to toss me nigga
The 45th I get em off me nigga
I block niggas Chris Bosh these niggas
I got figures pish posh to niggas
I dump niggas, jump, criss cross these niggas
The pump leave 'em slumped, in the car seat nigga

Be smart like a Harvard nigga don't start with niggas
And he got a problem with us
But nigga, I know how to solve it nigga
This is my son
I'ma tell 'em like Star Wars, "Lucas, I am your father" nigga
You a perpetrating, work for hire, twerk for payment
Busta Rhyme impersonating, worthless baby, irks him daily
Hurts to say it, burger flipping, birthed in 80s
Tryna be a 90s baby, thirty something tryna chase it
Tryna make it, rocks designer, kinda fakes it
Hates to face it
That he'll never be a nigga that be placed for A-list, niggas damn
Here's what he's thinking right now
"I'm Joyner Lucas, why did I start it with this guy?
Tory Lanez coming back what am I gonna do this time?
They ain't like none of my diss lines
Everybody knows I can spit it in quick time
Even if the lines is as shitty as 6ix9ine's
But this time they ain’t really letting me get by
Fuck I'm finna do with this shit now?
Damn I know this nigga finna be wild
Knowin' this nigga bout to kill me on it OD now
Don't nobody ever wanna book me for a show
I ain't got no songs when I go I spit freestyles
Try to make songs 'bout depression
But nobody ever get it
So I take it out on popping niggas beats now
I ain't never ever trapped
I ain't never slung a gat
But the world don't know so fuck it, I'm a G now"
Man, what the fuck wrong with him?
I know something wrong with him
I got a hundred bunch o' bullets 'bout to put 'em all in him
Nigga walked in with a hundred rounds in him
And he's seen a nigga chicken I was comin' down in it
Glock nine nigga gotta run around with it
I'ma son a nigga, keep it at least one-a-round with it
Backpack niggas ain't sellin' no records
Better dumb it down with it when you come around with it

This shit is easy man
Yo it's crazy nigga

Girl, you might've heard my songs, but you don't

Girl, I got a thing for you
Hustle with them dealers when it's time to get that bling for you
Knock it out the ring for you
Whoa, shawty, you know
Can I get a ring from you?
On the phone or a message, just somethin'
Can we get past all these one-word discussions?
I need to know, girl, I need to know somethin' 

'Cause you don't know my name
You don't know my name
'Cause you don't know my name, whoa
You don't know my name

'Cause you don't know my name


Girl, it's obvious you got some problems
It's obvious you got some issues

And it's obvious I'm here to fix you?
When I can't go no longer, I need someone stronger
To hold on to get through
And I stay by your side, girl, you know I'ma ride
And come to your rescue
You say that you know my name, the songs that I sing
The set that I bang, the shit that I claim
You don't know 'bout me, I've noticed
But you gon' know 'bout me, I know this

'Cause you don't know my name
You don't know my name
'Cause you don't know my name, whoa
You don't know my name

You don't know my name (You don't know my name)
'Cause you don't know my name


I fell in love with somebody, who doesn't even know my name
Know my name, no, no
And I know this, I'm ashamed
By my name, I'm not talkin' 'bout the name you call me, I'm talkin' 'bout who I am
And I know you don't know my name 
She knows the songs that I sing, all the shit that I claim
And even the set that I bang, but I'm certain she don't know
I'm tryna figure it out, but if she's walkin' out
She will never know my name, can't let her go

And I ain't tryna play no one
But he can't make you famous like this
No, he don't got you feignin' like this
Say, he might had your body but tonight I'm in yo' soul (Yo' soul)
Girl, just keep playin' my shit
Lo-love the way I talk, I make you love the way I sing (Sing)

Who needs love? (Uh, yeah)
Yeah, who needs love? Ayy

When I got these diamond VVS's on my neckpiece
Big pointers all in my bezel, call it my bestie
I spent a hundred and thou' and all countin'
Money make me happy every time I count it
Who needs love, when I come around flexin'?
I don't need no lovin' from any one of my exes
I don't need no stressin', phone call, textin'
Don't kiss me, bitch, kiss my necklace

Who needs love? Ayy
Baby, who needs love? Ayy

I got 20/20 vision when I see her
Pulled up in the Lamb', should've pulled up in the BM
Rippers in my denim 'cause a young nigga was flexin'
And if we end it early, baby girl, then it was destined
I even had to stop, answerin' your calls
A nigga had you trappin' with the scammers and the dawgs
Drivin' over border with the hammers in the car
When the cops pulled me over, would've hand it to my dawgs
I mean, who needs love with these hammers in my fists?
And she gon' fuck me over, give a damn about a bitch
Debit, credit cards on me, slammin' in this bitch
Don't wanna take her back, she did the damage in this bitch
Tell me, who needs love?

Who needs love? (Uh, yeah)
Yeah, who needs love? Ayy

When I got these diamond VVS's on my neckpiece
Big pointers all in my bezel, call it my bestie
I spent a hundred and thou' and all countin'
Money make me happy every time I count it

I don't need no lovin' from any one of my exes
I don't need no stressin', phone call, textin'
Don't kiss me, bitch, kiss my necklace

Who needs love? Ayy
Baby, who needs love? Ayy

Had to tell her, look here though
You could fuck a thousand niggas, only thing that's finna be hurt is your pussy, ho
And if I get at it, baby girl, you know I'm superstar status
Don't you ever try to play me like a rookie, though
Big, big dreams got you sittin' in a mansion
Laid up in my covers while you thinkin' 'bout expansion
Can't believe you even fucked that nigga, he a random
Had me embarrassed to tell the story to the mandem
Shawty, I ain't worried 'bout no nigga drip, I'm drippin' the best
The Cullinan seats orange, 'cause it's drippin' Hermès
No matter what she tellin' you, fuck, I dicked her the best
Fuck the drama, I put dick in her chest, yes

'Cause when I got these diamond VVS' on my neckpiece
Big pointers all in my bezel, call it my bestie
I spent a hundred and thou' and all countin'
Money make me happy every time I count it

Now if you decide, you'll say you'll be mine
Sit that ass by my side, ohh

So we can smoke
And you can let your stresses go
How personal
 
 
 
You got, somethin' that I do want, somethin' that you do got
You, so fly, I'll fly your ass, I'll fly you to Dubai
Move round the blue sky, drive in a new ride
You so bad you can't come, round my niggas
'Cause all us thirsty, really though
We be goin' in, like we all got curfews, really though
By the way, who the fuck, is knock-knockin' at the function?
Man, I hate when a nigga cockblockin' at the function
I'm tryna get laid tonight
Tryna find a group of all girls who down for their ladies night
'Cause you know it's on when I come
Pullin' up clean in my Nike Airs
Nightmares at the bottom
Got up mobbin' through the city of the eve
In my Yves Saint Laurent shirts and palm sleeves
But you know, that it's all for you
And when I'm down on the ground and fucked up
Girl, I'll call for you
Know that you're needed, know that you're needed

Got drivers to open the door now
Put diamonds in both of your drawers now
And you know this shit for you

Talk that shit 'til you back to your dad's house
I'm a real nigga from the T and O
I got a bad little bitch that let me beat on the floor
I remember nights I used to sleep on the floor
I see them days, I don't ever wanna go back no more
Now my little bitch wanna fuck my bitch and I'ma let her fuck her
Pull up in a new estate, I got a Bentley truck
Got Ciroc, in the shot, like it came from Diddy
Got a hundred wild niggas that won't change for pussy
How you doin'? How you like it? Let me whisper in your ear
Tell you a lil' something you might like to hear

I took the 95 to get from West Palm
Think I need a break from everything
Yes, I'm stressed way more than usual
I'm gettin' things back in order
Getting things back to how they used to be
Back to when the scrutiny had no effect on you and me
I miss driving with you in the passenger (Driving, yeah)
Feet up on my dash, we would see the sun lapse
Take you home, you would come see me before class
Makes more sense for you to crash with me but you never ask, oh why
Told you there's no need to be shy, oh why
I be waiting in the meantime, oh why
You always got me on stand by
When you know I need love
I'm missing when we was us
Miss when I wasn't famous, that's when we could be us
Kiss right in the street, fuck if anybody sees
Just friends, I don't think anybody believes
Hard to keep it PG with a nigga like me, goddamn

I fell in love with you, I fell in love, girl
I miss us
Nah, I won't front, got me so sprung
'Cause you, you're one of one (Hey)
It's no rush (Yeah, miss it)
I'm missing your touch (Your touch)
I'm missing your touch, oh
Missing when you kept in touch, oh-woah-oh (Oh, yeah)
When you kept in touch

Phone ringing

I took the 401 to get from Yorkdale
You're still looking like the baddest thing I done seen
Deflated before it started flattening
Way before the singer-rapper thing started happening
We were playing checkers, I was just tryna get back to king
I miss black tinted windows on your whip looking Amish
I'm just tryna put it down
You can put it on my tab
I'm putting you on your back
Then putting it in you slow
Then putting it in on a track, oh yeah
And I always tried to fall through
Ain't no Ws and dubbing me when I call you
I'm in first class
Thinking 'bout how you would get me right
Damn near made me miss the flight
Fucking you and get it right, yeah
You gon' bring me to that first time we fucked on the futon
Back then, I would do anything to get you alone
You would know me, all bullshit aside
So hit my line, I miss us

I fell in love with you, I fell in love, girl
I miss us (Baby, oh yeah)
Nah, I won't front, got me so sprung
'Cause you, you're one of one (You're one of one)
It's no rush (Yeah, miss it)
I'm missing your touch (Your touch)
I'm missing your touch, oh
Missing when you kept in touch, oh-woah-oh (Oh, yeah)
When you kept in touch
 
 
 
I got it in the worst way
Got me trapped in your love cage
Listen, listen
Your eyes don't glisten, glisten
Like they used to
And this ain't something that I'm used to, no

Uh, I landed in Miami with the top
Tryin' spend a lil time with a bad one
I got a lil motto, any bitch that you fuck
Make her badder than the last one
I'm pullin' in a S50, pullin' in a fuckin' S50, shawty
Stuntin' in a S50, stuntin' in a fuckin' S50

These niggas is talkin' and if they don't like it, sue me

That's what you need to do to be down for it, ah
Initiation, initiation
Initiation, initiation
You wanna get down with a nigga, you gotta be patient
Initiation, initiation

It's much easier than falling again
I know you won't cooperate
But I know far too much to buckle now

Pullin' up the cameo in Miami
She steppin' out the Maserati eyein' at me

Shawty get it poppin', shawty called Keiyanna

But I know far too much to buckle now

She hopped off the plane and she said her name
I wanna get ya, bitch, I wanna tame
Baby, you know you a piece for the P, nigga
One Umbrella, mad love, it's so hard to compete with us
Hop in the rari', I hijack the streets nigga
I'm all in the trap house, I'm duckin' the Dee's with her
I work out the work and she workin' for me, nigga
She'll do anything for some new Céline
All on the highway, all on the highway
My whip be smokey like it's from Friday
This shit amazin', this feel amazin', yeah
Grills in my mouth and I fucked her with Bathing Ape on
Holla at a real nigga shawty 'cause I know you need somebody
I'm not soundin' too insane, insane, insane
Hope what I'm sayin' don't sound insane, insane, insane
 
 
 
Yeah, word to Mazii, nigga (ah)
Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout, nigga?
Haha
When they swing that way to the right, you swing to the left, you heard?
Papiyerr

Woo, damn
I ain't been broke in a minute, don't get offended
Tore off the bow in a Bentley, 
fucking your ho in her kidney
Fuck up the city, I do not dance, I jiggy
Gun is tucked under this Fendi
I like it, I spend it, I just came right out the jeweller
The ice on my neck, and my wrist, and my fist, I ain't finished
I was just workin' at Denny's, came back and counted some millions
I ain't no regular civillian
Red, yellow, green, look like my neck a chameleon
Ugh, okay, spin it, ugh
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I hit his bitch, he offended
I'm in Givenchy and Fendi
They let me finish
I cut that Chevy for four day
My scammer bussing bottles off the '08
I cannot cuff, she fucking on my brozay
I'm just gon' fuck her, treat her like a throwaway
Ooh, damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I'm at the mall out in Venice
I need it, swiping the digits
Calling up Kelz, he did 250 on biddie
It ain't no biggie, uh
Moncler, kick it
Fucked that lil' bih, made a viddie
She wanna leak it
She wanna send it
Ayy, fuck that bitch, my face wasn't in it
Damn, bitch do scams on bitty
Bands in my hands look pretty
Hit another band on the 'gram, I'm litty
When I was broke, man, she fronted, but then I got rich and I hit it
Homie, I don't dance, I jiggy
Weed is so strong, I feel like I'm Popeye off the spinach
I cut the corner and bend it
Bitch, I'm a menace like Dennis
Don't sell me pussy, I need a percentage
If you gon' fuck me, this shit is expensive
Nordstrom Rack, swipe my gift
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, ayy (Woo, woo, woo)

I ain't been broke in a minute, damn (Woo)
I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo, woo, woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, damn
 
 
 
I find it funny how niggas start talkin' money
I'm livin' lovely, apartment far from the bunjee
I remember us livin' not too far from the junkies, the flunkees
That tried to punk me on corners but never sunk me
I swear, in this bitch, yeah I'm killin' this year
Them boys hated, they gon' feel it this year
I bought a 'Rari, I only drove in it once, I'm movin' different this year
I'm leavin' thousands, talkin' millions this year
When niggas really talkin', talkin' over, talk it over
Renegotiate and make the play and they cough it over
I crossed over like Iverson when he dropped the shoulder on Jordan
The feelin' more than the sport when you winnin' fuck how they feelin'
The feelings got left aside, I told them to step aside
I'm really eatin', I'm orderin'  extra sides, you know me
'Round the block, glovers spittin' them hot flows
My sense smells like Michelle was touchin' Barack's clothes
Presidential, the flow is so evidential
At the clearport customs, I barely show my credentials
Don't need it tinted, I want you to know who's in it
Had me offended last time that I walked in the Holt Renfrew
Let's break it down for 'em, account this
If every show is a hunnid thou' for him then that mean
A hunnid minutes on stage will equal a hunnid K
That's one thousand a minute so please don't get offended
If I walk inside a store and spend thirty-five in it
'Cause, to me, that's just thirty-five minutes
Land in Jamaica, sip on a Guinness and get it
Who wanna witness, my nigga? I'm really sick with the shiznit
I brought big Poppy out at the SumFest
Sean Kingston watched it from the side stage
I made triple the advance that he had gave me in my first year
Forty-five minutes of me on stage
And I'm not amazed, I think the tables turnin'
I think you learn from the bridge you burn when you see it burnin'
I think you learn from the world when you see it turnin'
I went from being a server to being this platinum deserver, you feel me?
Did a song with Meek Milly, called it "Litty"
Really I just did that shit for the city in love with Philly
God, this chinchilla fur on me, just in case it gets chilly
Burner on my side pocket, just that's in case you get illy out here
Me and Travis Scott almost fought at the Mala Luna
We both agreed shortly after that it was music
We possibly could be doin' that's bigger than tryna ruin it
So my apologies, nigga, just forgive me for doin' it
History made in New York City, we called a truce at the tower
I only brought a couple niggas with me
The beef was finished as soon as we took the picture, the world was watchin'
The attention in the industry started shiftin' to me
Lord forgive 'em, Lord forgive 'em, I was trippin' all the time
I spit subliminal dissin', just tryna rip shit
Not realizin' if I took the time to kick it and me and Drake mendin' bridges it'd probably equal to winnin'
Got the hardhead flow, money come in so thick
Them niggas call it hard bread dough
I'm in this all red four seater, I'm leanin' like the '06 fours
I said I'd stop freestylin' but fuck it, oh well
A nigga flow so well, I'm like a samplin' kit
Give a fuck 'bout who get pissed about by samples and skits
Niggas mad I'm remixin' they shit-pshh
Fuck out of here, nigga, stop being a bitch
I think it's time we cut the silence by niggas that's talkin' violent
Speak of silence and give 'em coffins and violins playin'
R&B niggas with Sisqó haircuts, wildin' and stylin'
They dissin', guess they just tryna go viral, I feel 'em
This your favorite song, this gon' be your favorite song
'Cept when I say it, it's really the people's favorite song
You did a vid dissin' to flex the i8
I could've flexed a 'Rari or Wraith, but nigga, I ain't
Instead, I bought my house the other day, I'm flexed in the paint
Real estate, I'm property shoppin', bitches probably watchin'
Got the Gadget-Go flow, Nobu and So-Ho
I've been crossed by some niggas I used to go toe-to-toe for
Blow for blow flow, sick enough to eat a blowfish
G5 jet playin' Go-fish, eatin' gold fish
Just for the record, I did this shit for the hopeless
Just drove a Rolls through the hood on the corner where I was homeless
It's Fargo
 
 
 
Adrenaline pumpin', heart pacing racing, altercations, we lit
Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit
Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip
Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit

And she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Brooklyn Myrtle Ave. is her birth place
Facin' the city, quotin' Biggie on all her worst days
I used to take the train with her so none of these lames get her
The danger of livin' from where she was at was a plain picture
I used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together
Instead of listen, she kinda just blew me off
Paid it no mind but it kind of just threw me off
I guess I figured everybody want riches and of course
But she just wanted a better family because her parents divorced
Early, her papa, he was taken by the force
Mother on crack and she never had time to bathe her
'Stead she gave her to her uncle, her brother who played the savior
'Til the day he started datin' this chick
That had put him up on mad pills and fuckin' up mad bills
She told me that one night he had got so fucked up
He fell asleep on his sofa, then woke up a new persona
And walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothing
And forcefully started chokin' her and tellin' her not to move
'Fore she could even finish, she broke out in tears and did it
Told me that for years, this night was a repetition, a feeling of fear
That she couldn't seem to exit or quit it, the feeling was there
Started talkin' lower as she told me come here
She said she had to make choices
So she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs, you feel
Ran off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel
Put the burner to his face with this aim to kill
And said, 
she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Figured that this intimidation was the worst case
She sat back and blew six in that boy face *gun shots*
Shot, him, dead

Said I want you on my head
No, I won't leave you lonely
You hold your head up high
I won't let go
'Cause I can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely

He don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
He got himself inside of this situation in the first place
He had no father figure, he told me that his papa got shot in the face
And he can't wait to find out who his killer
He dedicated his life and now wants to know this
To find out who had a motive to kill his only father
He felt, it had to be somebody close
It couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know him, but take this part in
When he was younger, he used to roll with his cousin
A woman that used to show him the ropes
She used to tell him
"Don't ever let no nigga or woman touch you
And if somebody do then all they would hear was the baka-baka-baka-baka"
One day, he was on the block rollin'
Then, this crack fiend woman came to him, told him
That she was his mother, man, that shit had him frozen
He ain't want to believe her 'til she said, 
"Boy, you got a birthmark above your scrotum
A scar up on your eye came from when you was four
When you fell off in the road"
At that point, he looked at her face and he froze
She told him hold on, it's something she gotta show him
She says to him, 
"I was gon' wait until you got older
But something was on my mind, was pressin', I had to show you
The whole block know me and the whole block know you
The whole block been knew this story but they ain't told you"
His mom says to him, 
"I hope you know your pop was a good man
But he just had some nonsense to him
Huh, well, one night, he's fucked up on the pills
I'm tryna tell him stop but everything I'm sayin' fails
You see, your lil' cousin in Brooklyn where we would leave ya, uh
I know she love you but the story's more deeper, uh
You see, your father used to be a creeper
He used to fuck her, used to touch her, used to beat her
Used to leave her so confused she would 
lace her own coke and reefer
Wait, I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper
You've been livin' this mission, you tryna figure who's the nigga
Or the perpetrator of killin' your pops, nigga?
 
When your cousin is the reason he got shot, nigga
She put six shots in him out the Glock, nigga"
His anger was dwellin' all on his mind
He didn't know what to do, he started grippin' his .9
And uh, before he knew it, he aimed it up at his mom
And uh, huh- *gun shots* -he shot her right in the spine
He said, "This is why my life has been full of lies
Don't nobody care for me, fuck it, what's the use in tryin'?
This Glock on my side, if I put it to my mind
I know that I'ma die but in Heaven, I'll be alive" *gun shot*

Adrenaline pumpin', heart pacing racing, altercations, we lit
Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit
Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip
Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit

Stunt, get jumped on, slashed or dumped on
Same block you pump on is the spot you get slumped on
Tory told me the story, it sounded a little crazy
A little Nas, a little 2Pac, Brenda's havin' a baby
How much pressure can you take 'fore you snap or break? Love turn to hate?
Fuck shit or fake, your next move may raise the murder rate
From average to savage, to semi-automatics
It's tragic how the static'll have us goin' at it *gun shot*

Said I want you on my head
No, I won't leave you lonely
You hold your head up high
I won't let go
'Cause I can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonelyGang shit, OFB, come on, free SJ man, you know how it gets

Boogie B, I ain't seen him in time
No, my fam told me I should stay from crime
More time I gotta stand on the line for the grind
Got a mash filled up with bine
My aunties still ask if I'm fine
A lot's on my mind but trust me, I'm fine
We hopped out, told Lerkz he's mine

Yo, she wanna do Bonnie and Clyde
Hop off the moped, show man about glides

Baking off with this brown skin hottie
But I might slap it off if I see them
Riding out in this stolen BM
Lz showed you it's the shotgun season
OFB ride out for no reason
Bro splashed him, the guys screaming "leave him"
More time we do drills in the evening
Broad day, I do it anywhere man see them
Bandokay, I'm a boss on my block
Call shots, ring shots at opps
This PR gets wrapped in socks
And the shotty so tall so we chopped it off
We got blessed with a brand new dots
Now I'm prayin' that we find a new link for Glocks
Red light, foot down, don't stop
Keep my foot on the gas, lay low from cops
I'm in Enfield town, back windows down
'Scuse me Miss, she leng and brown
Skeng on me when I'm rolling 'round
Cah I don't wanna end up dead in the ground
The wheels on the dings go 'round and 'round
Your whole estate gon' hear this sound
Bow, man got corn for clowns
You can call me too if he's there about

Look at her nails on fleek, yo
Slim fit ting drip head to her toe

Little man got himself battered
Slide on you, slide back? You're knackered
Shorty won't leave me alone

Full flick, big drip
Full clips, big sticks
Poppin' out O's outta big whips

Kissing on your neck then I'm coming for the shirt
Don't try to act now you on my turf
Got her so wet that a nigga might surf (Woo!)
Got her so wet that a nigga might surf
Don't play around with it cause I know what it's worth
This ain't nothing new girl I know what you like
Wanna play, wanna fuss, wanna nag, wanna fight
Every time you say that I'm wrong but I know that I'm right
You just want to get it in, you just want me to bite
All on yo neck, passionate sex
Play with the pussy, girl keep that wet
All the attitude you can keep that there
Deepstroke from the back while I'm pulling on yo hair

I give her that dick when she acting up

That's all she want when she acting up

When I sit back and think about it
Yeah, shit could be much worse
So I gotta think about it
Get off my ass and make this work
You know you gotta be about it
You don’t get shit sitting ‘round all day
Hustle is the only way
Only way to get that pay
Keep going, keep going, don’t stop
Grind hard till you hit the top
One day yo shit gone pop
One day yo shit gone pop
Keep going, keep going, don’t stop
Grind hard till you hit the top
One day yo shit gone pop
Keep going, keep going, don’t stop

Look, if it take one time to believe in yourself
Then you gotta wake up, make it happen
Been a young nigga on the grind for some time way back
Before I started rapping
And I picked up that pen, had my mind on the win
Self-made, they ain’t gave me shit but a whole bunch of hate
Nigga, why wait? I ain’t got no time, boy, I’m still going in
Can u tell me how it feel but fuck these bitches getting money
Grind hard, just stay hungry, don’t let a nigga take nothing from you
Don’t let a nigga play you like a dummy, make that money, be something
Don’t trade on your niggas, stay 100
Don’t trade on your niggas, stay 100
They see I came straight from that bottom
They don’t like that shit, oh, no
Fell in love with that success and damn, I gotta have some more
I don’t worry ‘bout you niggas, I ain’t stressing ‘bout no ho
I just focus on this money, I’m addicted, that I know


This shit real to me, they don’t really know how it feels to be
Diagnosed with cancer and leukemia
Which means not a nigga ill as me
But it won’t get me my credit for it
I gotta dream it, hating ass nigga, you can’t destroy it
They don’t play me on the radio
‘Cause I don’t rap about shit I can’t afford
I’m riding with a gun, I’m paranoid
‘Cause when you in the streets death and jail is two things that you can’t avoid
Man, this shit don’t happen over night
I’m the dopest nigga rapping over mics
But I’m tryna do something different
Nigga, I been trapping all my life
I keep it hood in each verse, I smoke kush and chief purp
I got a bad lil’ bitch, life could be worse
 
 
 
Feel like you owe me that pussy
Owe me that pussy, owe me that pussy
Feel like you owe me that pussy
Owe me that pussy, owe me that pussy
Girl don't try to play with that pussy
Play with that pussy, play with that pussy
Feel like you owe me that pussy
Owe me that pussy, owe me that pussy
Feel like you owe me that pussy
Girl don't try to hide that pussy
I'm just tryin' to provide for that pussy
Let me take a little ride with that pussy

I feel like I know what you're feelin'
Waitin' for me to get in it
All of them times that you played with that pussy
I'm all on your legs like some linen
Hold up this just the beginnin'
Seem like we're both out here sinnin'
Just throw it at me, I'm hittin' home runs
Let's act like we're in the 9th innin'
I don't wanna play no more games with you
I just wanna put this thing on you
The way that you act got you cuffin' that cat
Maybe you can teach me a thing or two
Don't need no flag, I'ma bang with you
Fuck around and get in that ring with you
Bone, bone
I'm just doin' what I came to do


Girl it's too late, you can't hide it
Let's go to war with no violence
I can tell right now you gon' need a pillow
Cause damn, girl, you just can't keep quiet
She love it when I sing so melodic
I swear that pussy exotic
Stop all that playin'
Let me just get a lil' taste, please let me try it
Give me one hit, I'ma knock it out the park
Plenty fish in the sea and I'm actin' like a shark
I'm a dog with this shit so a nigga might bark
Got the pussy on flood, might need Noah's Ark
Ye ain't hittin' that right if the pussy don't fart
Ye ain't hittin' that right if the pussy don't fart

When it rains I think of you
When all them nights I was there with you
Through the pain, why you do me like that?
Turned your back
But don't worry, girl I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, girl I'm good
What's in the past gon' stay there
I can't make the same mistakes therefore I'm good
I told a thousand lies to prevent the cries
Now it's good bye cause I realized I'm good
Now I done moved on, feeling gone
I'm good

She say that I'm acting different
She say I'm not the same nigga
Last time I checked when I looked in the mirror
Bitch I was the same nigga
But I do apologize for all them times I made you cry
Even though I tried to make that bullshit work
Guess we couldn't see eye to eye
And I'm not the guy that you fantasize
You couldn't hold on that I'm on the rise
Now I got a new bitch, don't act surprised
I'm just a young nigga tryna multiply
My bankroll, and I know I'm not perfect at all
Just want to know are you there when I fall?
If ain't real I don't want it at all
Will you be there when I call?

When it rains I think of you
When all them nights I was there with you
Through the pain, why you do me like that?
Turned your back
But don't worry, girl I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, girl I'm good
What's in the past gon' stay there
I can't make the same mistakes therefore I'm good

Time go by and I see you
That yo ass got a brand new nigga
I just hope that you happy
I just hope that you happy
And I ain't gon' lie, yah it be some nights
That I really do miss you
But I just hope that you happy
I just hope that you happy
But he can't fuck you like I do
Can't fuck you like I do
Lick you up, now turn your ass around

Baby ain't no room
So I ain't really worried about you
I ain't really worried about you

Cause everywhere I go these hoes be the same
She really asking where the cheese at
It really ain't nothing for me to pick your brain
But I learned
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
She don't know my name, she just see the chains
And she want the fame, girl stay in yo lane
She must love the pain cause she will never change
I thought you was different, maybe I was trippin'
Maybe I was trippin', learn from my mistakes
You can get replaced, look at me I'm straight
But I learned
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same

I was six years old
Riding shotgun in an old school with my dad
Memories that I hold on to
Cause really those the only ones that I had
They used to call me Lil' Rock
Skinny big head nigga with a rock
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the hard
Even though my fam used to keep the grams in the socks, damn
It was me, lil Brandon and Nene
Outside running wild, fuck TV
On 13th all the way the 49th and Chambers
Shout out to my lil cuz Veve
And my uncle Jerome
One time for my uncle Jerome
In the basement smoking cigarettes with Tyrique
I think we did that when unc wasn't home
47th and Lloyd, first time I got jumped on the porch
Hit the oldest one with the one two, bink bink
Other one ran up, left him right there on the porch
Hell is you saying? Lil Jeff turned me into a man
That was big bro, that was big cuz
Everything to a nigga now he gone
Guess God had a plan I don't understand
Lord why you do me this way? You live and you learn
Them tables will turn, them bridges will burn
But through it all, just make a way
I'm here to stay and I'ma do it for my city like the mayor
Real northside nigga
 living life like my grandaddy Charles
He the reason why a nigga is a player

Let me talk to 'em, yeah, hah
Plenty nights when I felt all alone, nobody to lean on
Listen up, let me tell you how it feel
Hah, look
I just tell it how it is, everybody claim they real
On the real these niggas ain't ever been real
Straight up, hah, look
I'm just living my life, I'm just doing my thang
Same nigga from the jump, baby I ain't gon' change
Hah, baby I ain't gon' change
Nah, nah, baby I ain't gon' change

Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be the shit is the shit
Who knew?
Still ridin' 'round with my day one niggas
We don't need new niggas in the crew
One time for my nigga Dan
That was my first friend second grade Miss Blue
I don't do too much
Nigga just say what's up, man salute when you see me
These niggas upset cause they heard I got next
I keep cheese like Fellini's
Back in the day I used to be a hot head
Like I'm walkin' 'round with a beanie
In the middle of the summer
I'm just tryna score, nigga, no time to fumble
It's game time, everybody on time
We just tryna get this money at the same time
I ain't claimin' what ain't mine
Got your girl on the edge like the state line
Ain't no mo play time
We just tryna get it off the muscle
Fighting for the money, how much hustlel
I'ma get my bitch to respect my hustle forreal
Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be the shit
Is the shit, who knew
Straight up, hah, look
I'm just livin' my life, I'm just doin' my thang
Same nigga from the jump

What's the point of getting that money?
Money ain't money if your life don't change
What's the point of pushing that whip
If you ain't changing lanes?
What's the point of having many girls
If your bitch don't change?
What's the point of staying the same
If everything around you change?
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed
If everything around you changed
All I need is change

You don't need nobody, you don't need nobody
They don't want to be here, they ain't got to be here
You don't need nobody, you don't need nobody
They don't want to be here, they ain't got to be here
 
 
 
{Hook}
I been getting money I ain't worried 'bout a ho
You better check your bitch cause she been creeping on the low
No matter the occasion I'ma always get the dough
Throw it at the strippers watch 'em get it off the flo'
I been getting money, I been I been getting money
I been getting money, I ain't worried bout a ho
I been getting money, I been I been getting money
I been getting money, watch 'em get it off the flo'
{Verse 1}
I been getting money I ain't worried bout a ho
Know niggas with the white call it Marilyn Monroe
No need to spit the game because I had her at Hello
But she always bitching cause I'm in the studio
Hopscotch the pussy so you know I'm in and out
I scramble for the cheese like I work at Waffle House
The game needs change and i found it in the couch
I swear these niggas trash they remind me of the grouch
Hold up, wait a second, I'm gone!
I'ma sprint to the bill like a phone
Raise your hand if you getting that paper
Or you want that shit like foams
I'ma north side nigga, rep your zone
Fuck your rules, I'm grown
You better check your ho cause last night she ain't even come home
{Hook}
{Verse 2}
Do you get the picture? I ain't talking Instagram
Alley-Oop to Donald and I know he 'bout to slam
I just want to smoke and take a trip to Amsterdam
And hit a couple hoes who pussy just as sweet as yams
Baby I'm a player but I'm acting like the coach
Dive inside your water, hit you with the backstroke
Hungry for the green and i ain't talking artichoke
I drive these hoes crazy hope my license ain't revoked
You know these hoes don't love you, they'll fuck you for a check
Then play you like a sucker
Stay on your A game, don't get played like a buster
I'ma always stay true nigga word to my mother
{Hook}

Grab the mic started flowing plenty doubted I kept going
Plenty years in that booth perfecting craft I had to show em
While y'all sleeping I was working all night getting it in
Mama looking at me crazy cuz I failed a class again
Couldn't work a 9 to 5 cuz that shit ain't for me
In my head had vision one day i'll be on TV
Putting on for side but I knew I had to grind

Stayed focus had a dream then I hit them billboards

Look , yeen from the north
Me,Bo,jane , cam smoking blunts on the porch
Use  to call on my niggas for support
Yeen with the shit now then ya ass fell short
Knowing damn while I suppose to be in court
2 years no L's in a Infinity sport
Smoking big blunts when I'm s'pose to report
Ducking my P.O taking trips to New York
Aye, dem niggas ain't with my niggas
Always gon ride for my niggas
And if a fuck nigga wanna play around
I'm bucking outside with my niggas
Ain't nun outside but my niggas

Long as my niggas just stay down
Imma go get the money witcha


They don't live like my nigga
I'll kill like my nigga
Ride or die like my nigga
Homicide like my nigga
I ride for you , you ride for me
You drank the brew I like the weed
If you see ah nigga talking to the police (shit)
Niggas ain't with my niggas
They can't be
My niggas never folding in
My nigga then , my closest kin
Lost both of my close friends
Man, what is you saying
Shit hits the fan
My click appear
Feel good to popping bottles
Feels better being real
Aye man , say man
What the business is
We real , y'all fake
Get out the V.I.P
Y'all leeches , y'all snakes
You can tell how I talk , dey ain't with me
They don't shine bright
Look funny and dey pants too damn tight
 x2I’ma do everything in my strength to keep you near
Let’s go

All the many days you were on my mind
Visions of me with you all the time
I do whatever puts a smile on my baby's face
My best friend and you can never be replaced

Yuh, yo
I'm on that homicide, suicide, drama like Islamabad
Under God, goin' overboard like the Amistad
Ringin' bells, it was 2012 back in ‘95
I made it out alive, now, finally, I've arrived
But still threw back to all my other blue black
People that's stickin' to it like mice to a glue trap
My work speak for itself, so I don't interrupt
I am an expert, this is no beginner's luck
If you denyin' the truth, then I don't give a fuck
Otherwise, get your hands and your antennas up
As we go into our initial decent, I'm alive, but only fifty percent
I’m prayin' God give me the strength

It’s like somebody turned on the light (Turned on the light)
It’s like somebody started a fire and I feel so alive
Finally, I’ve realized that I don't have to tell myself twice
I know that you've changed my whole life
And if I know there’s one thing that’s the truth
I know I’d be lost if I lost you

(Here in my life, just you and I)
What am I gonna do?
(Here in my life, just you and I)
My best friend and you can never be replaced

They say tomorrow’s not promised today
But today I promise if we don’t make our own way, somebody’ll take it from us
Snatch it like rats to cheese
So, Lord, help me please 'cause I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I’m bulletproof
Cockin' the Glock and aim and shoot
My future’s ever clear, a 180 proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride and drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreamin' of better days, dreamin' of better pay
But we got our work cut out for us, so we better pray
Pray to uphold the weak, not for eternal sleep
But if I die, I pray the Lord my soul to keep

It’s like somebody turned on the light (Turned on the light)
It’s like somebody started a fire and I feel so alive
Finally, I’ve realized that I don't have to tell myself twice
I know that you've changed my whole life
And if I know there’s one thing that’s the truth
I know I’d be lost if I lost you

(Here in my life, just you and I)
(Here in my life, just you and I)
You can never be replaced
 
 
 
It seems like just the other day that we hooked up
(I was drivin', you was walkin' and I swooped you up)
From that moment on I knew you were the one, yeah
(I was single, you was lonely and we fell in love)
We would sit and talk for hours about anything
(Baby, you hang up, no, you hang up, on three hang up)
I bought your whip, I paid your rent, I gave you everything
(Said you'd always be my baby then you bounced)
How you gonna?

How you gonna up and leave me now?
How you gonna act like that?
How you gonna change it up, we just finished makin' up?
How you gonna act like that?
How you gonna act like we don't be makin' love
You know we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff, that ghetto love
How you gonna trip, how could you forget
How you gonna act like that

Girl, I never thought that lovin' you would hurt
(I did everything a good man would to make it work)
Girl, you should have told me you had second thoughts
(Like before I put the down on the house we bought)
Now I'm thinkin' you and me was a mistake
(But then it hits me and I'm missin' all the love we made)
Girl, I know that we've been goin' through some things, yeah
(But the sun is somewhere shinin' even when it rains, oh)

I'll be the one you kick it to
I'll be the one that misses you
I'll be the one to ease your pain
I'll be the one you won't forget
And you'll be the one I can't forget
You'll be the one that's Heaven sent
You'll be the one I can't deny
You'll be the one that makes me cry, baby

How you gonna up and leave me now? (Why you do)
How you gonna act like that? (Why you gotta act like this?)
How you gonna change it up? (Whoa, ho, baby) We just
Finished makin' up
How you gonna act like that? (But I need you)
How you gonna act like we (Oh) don't be makin' love
(Whoa: baby, baby)
You know we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff, that ghetto love
How you gonna trip, how could you forget?
How you gonna act like that?

You know I'm willin' to do anything
Just to keep you in my heart (Keep you in my heart)
I messed around and gave up everything
I thought we'd never part (Yes, I did, baby)
I was a player and made the choice to give my heart to you
And I gotta keep it that way, ooh, baby

How you gonna up and leave me now? (Ooh, baby)
How you gonna act like that? (Why you gotta treat me this way?)
How you gonna change it up? (Why you treat me wrong?)
We just finished makin' up
How you gonna act like that? (Can me somebody tell me why)
How you gonna act (Why, why) like we don't be makin' love? (Hey)
You know we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff, (Oh, oh, baby) that ghetto love
How you gonna trip? (All my friends became your friends)
How can you forget? (All my ends became your ends)
How you gonna act like that

Keepin' love ghetto (All I want is you)
Keepin' love ghetto (All I need is you)
Keepin' love ghetto (All I need is you)
Keepin' love ghetto (All I need is you, all I need is you, babe)

How you gonna up and leave me now? (Oh, babe, how you gonna act like that)
How you gonna act like that? (Hey, hey)
How you gonna change it up? (Oh) We just finished
Makin' up (Why you actin' so changed, oh, oh, baby)
How you gonna act like that? (Anything you want in me I got ya, hey)
How you gonna act like we don't be makin' love?
You know we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff (Why you actin' so changed), that ghetto love
How you gonna trip? (Oh, oh, baby)
How can you forget?
How you gonna act like that?

And I heard that you were taken
But that don't have to stop you from making
Late night phone calls on the telephone
About your fantasies and ways to get it on
When you need me I will be
There for you my sweet lady

Sweet lady (Would you be my)
Would you be my (Sweet love for)
Sweet love for a lifetime? (A lifetime)

So I won’t even front (I won’t front, no)
Just say you'll give it to me
Don't wanna hear the maybe's oh no no no
( And I will give you all my heart) All my heart

I need your forgiveness and your mercy too
I must be all kind of crazy what I’ve done to you
I hope  you understand that my heart is true
Mistakes I’ve made, but 
I’m making change for you
Have I learned is your question, and my answer I have
If you’re expecting perfection, then we’re not gon’ last
This is not an excuse, I’m just telling the truth
Baby I’m so sorry for hurting you

Oh, I’m ashamed of me, (shame on me)
Wish I never done you wrong, (shame on me)
Every night of us I dream that I wake up in your arms
 (Oooh ooh oooo)

I know why you left me, but since you’ve been gone
My understanding has more than grown
I come to this conclusion over and over again
I don’t want an enemy, I just want back my friend

Oh, I’m ashamed of me, (shame on me)
I Wish I never done you wrong, (shame on me)
Every night of us I dream that I wake up in your arms

Yeah
Wish I could say sorry, oh and you come back home hey babe, yeah
I wish diamonds could do it, so I wouldn't have to be alone, yeah
If I knew then what I know now, everything would be fine
Yeah, yeah, hey

Oh, I’m ashamed of me, (shame on me)
Wish I never done you wrong, (shame on me)
Every night of us I dream that I wake up in your arms
 (Arms)

I’m ashamed of me, (shame)
I’m ashamed of all the lies I told, (shame)
Wish I come home, wish I come home at night, (shame)
Girl I wish I never creeped,  (shame)
Said I’m ashamed, baby I thought there was something better out there then me, there (shame)
Come on baby, what am I supposed to tell these kids? Babe
Baby I’m ashamed
I’m so sorry babe, I’m so sorry
 
 
 
I really messed up
Can you call me back babe?
I really messed up
Can you call me back babe?

I don't know why I've been making her feel this way
I ain't even smooth with my bullshit, I do it right in her face
It ain't like I don't love her, already gave her that ring
I hope you know, hope you know, how much I really wanna change
Why would I wanna wake up in the morning without you by my side?
And why do I gotta see you in tears just to make a nigga realise?

How do I explain it?
Every time I try to say no, I can't run from it
Baby you my favourite
Why do you be asking me questions when you already know that

I be doing dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb shit
I be doing dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb shit
I be doing dumb shit
(I be doing dumb shit)
I be doing dumb shit
I be doing dumb shit
I be doing dumb shit
(I keep doing dumb shit)
You're the only one I love but
I be doing dome shit

I swear I tried, I tried, no lie
Seems like I fail, I fail, every time
I'm sloppy with the cheating
Always catch me creeping
Don't ask me why I do it, cause I ain't got a reason
All I know is, I be doing dumb shit

I be doing dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb shit
I be doing dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb shit
I be doing dumb shit
(I be doing dumb shit)
I be doing dumb shit
I be doing dumb shit
I be doing dumb shit
(I keep doing dumb shit)
You're the only one I love but
I be doing dome shit

Oh naw, big Snoop Dogg
Party all night and we like blowing them bombs
Suit game Gucci, steak at the Palm
Cootchie Lootchie, black tie, bring me them all
What it is, what it do, Snopp DO dub?
Is there any way that you can get us in the club?
Girl I'm buzzin' with a cousin and a set of twins
Diggin', duggin, shit here I go again
It's certain mo'fuckers that I run with
That keep me on some Bobby Shmurda dumb shit
I'm creepin' while you sleepin' but you woke up
Speak up, spoke up, make a nigga choke up
So right, so wrong, so what?
If we break up, I'm the one that's broke up
Picking and choosing, that lil' bitch with we
I woke up in the morning on TMZ, ooh wee

Uhm, I don't mean no harm
But your boy Black Ty's got a mean ol' arm
I got exposed when she went through my DMs
Now I got problems with my BM
I ain't wanna be him
Dumb shit, doin' the most when I know better
But knowin' better, and doin' better and showin' better
Dumb shit in these streets and doin' what I want
When I should be doin' what made you put me on
Your independant and smart, you got your own everything
Million niggas want you but I'm the one you're drawn to
Been through it all but you still hold me down
Got pain in your smile and you refuse to frown
Baby I'm sorry I embarrassed you
Walking in a room full of bitches I didn't touch and they ain't even banished
Your voicemail full but the text said read
I pray to God our love ain't dead baby I swear

I swear I tried, I tried, no lie
Seems like I fail, I fail, every time
Can't get caught again cause I swore that I was gon' change
Got me working overtime in my phone changing all these names all night
But the city so small, they probably end up talking
And if she finds out, she'll probably end up walking
But I'mma take my chances to gamble either way
And why would I wanna start over when I got you at home?
Tryna get a million girls I'mma just end up alone

How do I explain it?
Every time I try to say no, I can't run from it
Baby you my favourite
Why do you be asking me questions when you already know that

I be doing dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb shit
I be doing dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb shit
I be doing dumb shit
(I be doing dumb shit)
I be doing dumb shit
I be doing dumb shit
I be doing dumb shit
(I keep doing dumb shit)
You're the only one I love but
I be doing dome shit
 
 
 
I can't imagine life
Without you by my side
This is love baby that I'm feeling
And I'm hoping
That you're feeling the same way
Things tend to slip my mind
Like how you like to wine and dine, baby
With romantic lights, you mean a lot to me
In so many ways

Lately
Have I told you I love you
Lately
Have I told you you still mean the world to me
Lately
Have I told you I love you
I'll be your wishing well
Tell me what you want baby

Don't think twice of our love
I say these things because
I love you but it's hard to explain
And I'm hoping that you're feeling the same way
You know that all of my
Feelings are inside
And verbally I tend to forget
How much I L-O-V-E you really means

Lately
Have I told you I love you
Lately
Have I told you you still mean the world to me
Lately
Have I told you I love you
I'll be your wishing well

Just like a drug but better, baby I'm stuck on that
Can't get enough of our magic
Think I fell in love with that ounce
Hopin' that you call, going through withdrawal
When you stop dealing with me girl, it's like the sky falls
Ain't no use in going to rehab as I keep going back to what she had

Just one more hit baby
Gives me that feeling one more time

I'm a addict, I'm a addict
Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
Running in my veins, I can't leave you alone
I'm a addict, I'm a addict
Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
I know I gotta have you no matter what it costs

Baby what have you done cause I'm fiending
Whatever it is baby I need it
I'm tryna be strong but can't wait
They say I'm lost in your love and I believe it
So when I need a fix, you be my connect
Go too long without it girl, it's like I'm a mess
Ain't no use in going to rehab
Cause I keep going back to what she had

Just one more hit baby
Gives me that feeling one more time

I'm a addict, I'm a addict
Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
Running in my veins, I can't leave you alone
I'm a addict, I'm a addict
Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
I know I gotta have you no matter what it costs

I've been tryna quit and quit and cold turkey
It don't matter what I do, it ain't working
Girl what you're doing got me strung out
Gon' have me tweaking if you run out
But clearly I got it back
Anytime I leave I come running back
Girl I'm losing control
Cause you're all in my soul

I'm a addict, I'm a addict
Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
Running in my veins, I can't leave you alone

Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
I know I gotta have you no matter what it costs

I’m lost for words, nothing left to say
I know you’re hurt so I won't beg you to stay, no
You know as well as I do that girl I really love you

And I wouldn’t last a day if you ever ever left me
Girl don’t take this the wrong way, I’m not begging you to stay
But the truth is If you ever leave
I would be, I would be helpless
You would  be, you would be hopeless
I’m like a sea, sea without a beach
What would I be, tell me?

Is it worth nights with no sleep, bed with cold sheets
Waking up without me, baby
I don’t wanna see what that would be
So please, baby don’t leave

I’m feeling anxious now cause it could go either way
If i’m honest with myself girl, got me feeling real crazy
And I know I played a part in the games that got us here baby

And I wouldn’t last a day if you ever ever left me
Girl don’t take this the wrong way, I’m not begging you to stay
But the truth is If you ever leave
I would be, I would be helpless

What would I be, tell me?

Is it worth nights with no sleep, bed with cold sheets
Waking up without me, baby
I don’t wanna see what that would be
So please, baby don’t leave

Now I know that I may not have the right words to say
But my actions don’t lie, can't you see I’m changing everyday baby
The further that you go away, the more and more this heart’s gon’ break

No I wouldn’t last a day if you ever ever left me
So don’t take this the wrong way, I’m not begging you to stay
But the truth of it is If you ever leave
I would be, I would be helpless
You would be, you would be hopeless
Like a sea, sea without a beach
What would I be, tell me?

Is it worth nights with no sleep, bed with cold sheets
Waking up without me, baby
I don’t wanna see what that would be
So please, baby don’t leave

Cause I can’t do it without you
Just the thought of rolling over and you’re not there
Drives me crazy bay
Baby baby

Love the way you’re looking from down here
Come a little bit closer babe, let me feel it
Your body feels so soft against my skin
There’s nothing left to do but let me in it
Once I get you in my bed
Girl you wanna run and tell all your friends
Cause I’m about to give you bragging rights to everything we did last night

I like the way you bite your lip when I, when I hit that spot
Scratches on my back, they’re showing what it is right now
And I don’t want it to stop
When we’re making love
When we make love
Every move you make it feels so right
I don’t ever want it to end baby
How bout we make it last all night, you can be my forever lady

Girl you going crazy, screaming my name right now
Cause I’m hitting that spot
 shake, your knees is grazing, you know what it is right now
And I don’t want it to stop

When we’re making love
Tonight let’s wake up the neighbors baby
When we make love

Girl I wanna give you all of me
So don’t obey, just let yourself go
Let your love rain down on me
Feeling so good I have you begging for more

When we’re making love
Girl when you scream my name it let’s me know, it let’s me know I’m doing my thing
When we make love
I don’t wanna hold back baby, I don’t wanna hold back baby
When we make love
Let your body on mine
When we make love

Why your legs all up in the air like that
I ain’t complaining cause I like 'em up there like that
 
 
 
There’s a first time for everything so I knew this day would come
Took me long enough to get it, but I knew you were the one
First of all let me apologize for putting you through so much
I’ll be foolish man, to ever mess this up

You caught me by surprise, I thought I’d seen everything
Until I looked into your eyes, til I found what I was missing

Girl, prior to you, I never seen something so beautiful
Baby, prior to you, I’d never seen something so fly
Prior to you, though that love was juts a fairytale
Then you came a long and showed me how to love again

If there’s such a thing as heaven sent, girl that'll be you
It’s all new to me, cause I’ve never been so over the moon
It happened to me right when I was bout to turn my luck card in
If you hadn’t showed up when you did, I’d be through it, it caught me baby

You caught me by surprise, I thought I’d seen everything
Until I looked into your eyes and then I found what I was missing

Girl, prior to you, I never seen something so beautiful
Baby, prior to you, I’d never seen something so fly
Prior to you, though that love was juts a fairytale
Then you came a long and showed me how to love again

Sunset over the ocean tails in comparison
Somewhere out of this world’s gotta be where you’re from
I don’t know what I did to deserve this love that you give
Been in love before but still

Girl, prior to you, I never seen something so beautiful
Baby, prior to you, I’d never seen something so fly
Prior to you, though that love was just a fairytale
Then you came a long and showed me how to love again
Show me love again
 
 
 
Someone call the doctor, hurry please
There’s an empty space where my heart’s supposed to be
Cause my girl left and she took it with her
So I’ll stop at nothing to get her
And I don’t have much time left
It’s like I just took my last breath

The room is dark and the temperature is getting low
The doctor said I’m suffering from a lack of love
Come back cause I don’t wanna fall apart

I can’t live without my heart
No, I can’t live without my heart
Now you got me tripping cause
I give you life support in your time of need
So how could you turn around and pull the plug on me
You’re the only thing I ever knew about love

Girl I can’t live without you
The stakes are high but my blood pressure’s getting low
My body seems to get weaker every time you go
I'd risk my life baby just to save us
Cause I don’t stand a chance if I ain't with ya
And I know it’s my fault but I’m not prepared to take this kinda' loss

The room is dark and the temperature is getting low
The doctor said I’m sufferin' from a lack of love
So come back cause I'm about to fall apart

I can’t live without my heart
I can’t live without my heart
Now you got me tripping cause
I gave you life support in your time of need
So how  could you turn around and pull the plug on me
You’re the only thing I ever knew about love

Two fingers on my neck tryna find my pulse
And now I’m struggling to breathe cause the pain done collapsed my lungs
I know one day that we all gotta leave from here
But I’m way too young and my love’s not done
Shock me back to life and give me another try
I can’t live without my heart
No I can’t live without you
 
 
 
How come it seems like, when it comes to forever
We gotta think twice
And I already know that one night, without you
Girl it’s just enough to make me go crazy

Ain’t that the truth cause
Cause even if I tried I couldn’t fool ya
See every single time I’d rather choose ya
Cause I know for sure, through all the love and war, I’m your lady

I don’t wanna wait around just cause we got time
You know I got your heart and I know you got mine
So why just be alone when we could be alone together

'Cause baby I don’t wanna look back and regret anything
And you've been here all this time
I don’t wanna look back and regret anything
So let’s make the most of all we know today

Everything is everything whenever I’m around you boy
(And girl thought had everything until I bumped right into you)
Said that you could warm up my coldest shoulder
(Baby I’ma sunshine when the rain is over)
I’ll be here through whatever
Cause I know for sure
Through all the love and war we'll be together

I don’t wanna wait around just cause we got time
You know I got your heart and I know you got mine
So why just be alone when we could be alone together

Cause baby I don’t wanna look back and regret anything
And you’ve been here all this time
I don’t wanna look back and regret anything
So let’s make the most of all we know today

Baby me and you should sit down and talk
Cause there’s a lot of things going on
Baby I don’t wanna look back and regret
That me and you didn’t make up
Now baby I'm here, I'm here
(I know you ain't going nowhere)
Girl I know we’re gonna be right here

I don’t wanna look back and regret anything
You've been here all this time
I don’t wanna look back and regret anything
I leave home today
Oh lets make the most of all we know today
I don’t wanna look back babe
Baby I forgive you and I hope you forgive me
 
 
 
Swag central
See what we have here is
An open invitation to the first day of the rest of your life..
Rese!

Just pulled up to the club in a McLaren, got niggas like "oh"
We hopped out and the girls followed us as we escorted to the top floor
Got bottles in one hand, cash in the other
Stacks flying everywhere, need an umbrella
Black card's unlimited, keep on spending it, cause I got money to blow

After we leave this club, it's on
Yeah you already know
Got a lot of fly chicks trying to leave with me
So now I'm ready to go
I've got so many, might need an extra car
Don't worry about drinks, baby, I bought the bar
Bottles everywhere, don't need an Entourage
I know I do it big, but Big I hustle hard

I swear I make it look too easy
Niggas wishing they could be me
Naw, haters can't see me cause I'm too hot for TV
If you chickens don't believe me
Put it in your face like green beans
That attitude is so greasy.. I make it look too easy

You can't get what I get unless you got a passport
Because my swag is so... international
From Brazil all the way to Tokyo
I bet you haters thought I would never blow
Now I'm doing what bosses do
Calling out shots from the VIP and all the chicks wanna roll with me
Cause they know

After we leave this club, it's on
Yeah you already know
Got a lot of fly chicks trying to leave with me
So now I'm ready to go
I've got so many, might need an extra car
Don't worry about drinks, baby, I bought the bar
Bottles everywhere, don't need an Entourage
I know I do it big, but Big I hustle hard

I swear I make it look too easy
Niggas wishing they could be me
Naw, haters can't see me cause I'm too hot for TV
If you chickens don't believe me
Put it in your face like green beans
That attitude is so greasy.. I make it look too easy

I wake up and piss excellence
Good Lawd! This the New Testament
There's one life to live for dead presidents
So ben frank don't insult my intelligence
Get it? Meaning money, I'mma get it!
You love it don't ever own it, you rent it, you just a tenant
Forget it, I'm in the Guinness like Dennis, I'm just a menace
To society, Luda will pop eyes for the spinach
Yeah, I'm on that lyrical tip
Plus the coupe's all-white, it's a miracle whip
Then I'm in between the sheets, say I'm flipping the script
With two bad foreign woman: dual citizenship
'Rese!

After we leave this club, it's on

Tyrese spoken voice:

Yeah, I wanna dedicate this song
To Africa and 126, let's go
(oooooooooooooooh...)
I come to you humble and grateful
For my freedom
Not only freedom physically but freedom of the mind
And freedom of my Spirit
In Jesus name, Amen
Verse 1:
Don't leave me out cause I'm black
Don't leave me out cause I'm white
Leave me cause I'm treating you wrong
When I'm supposed to treat you right (ooh)
Don't leave me out in the cold
Treat me like I'm 12 years old
Visitor, I'm from Africa
And I can stand wherever I want (ooh)
I can see it so clearly
Soon as I stare in your eyes
Yeah you're making more money than me
That don't mean I'm not qualified
I wake up every morning (I wake up)
With a smile on my face (smilin')
Thanking the Lord for giving me
Another opportunity to feed my family, ooh aah
First I try to come up
And you hold me down
First you let me in
Then you kick me out
Can somebody tell me
What is a man to do?
Everyday I pray to the man above
Can he stop the hate and show me some love
Turn to Chapter 126, all she wanted for us was
Chorus:
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, ooh
Freedom, don't want to
Freedom, oooh Freedom, oooh Freedom, oooh

Mentally and Spiritually

Tyrese Spoken voice:
We thank Mandela and everyone whose
Contributed to the freedom of Africa

Soon as you try to say no (no)
I'm coming right back to say yes (yes)
You're giving me fuel to my fire
Another reason to pump my fist, ooh
You make so much money off us (off us)
In return you don't show us no love (no love)
In movies, documentaries still
Hungry kids all in the streets, ooh

With a smile on my face (smilin')
Thanking the Lord for givin' me another opportunity
To feed my family, first I
First I try to come up
Then you hold me down

Why ya tryna be where I'll be (I be)

But in the meantime, just keep one thing in mind
The way you dress, the way you drive
Was all because of me
Now it's over
Babe, I hope you're happy

That disappearing thing
(I don't play that)
I know your phone ain't off
('Cause I pay that)
Am I ok with it, please believe it

If you don't give a damn about me (Damn about me)
Let's see how you do without me (Without me)
Why ya tryna be where I'll be (I be)
You don't give a damn about me

You're the last thing that crosses my mind
Why you gotta call me, baby

Why'd you call me (Baby)
If you don't give a damn about me (Damn about me)
Let's see how you do without me (Without me)
Why ya tryin' to be where I'll be (I be)
You don't give a damn about me

I don't understand it
Takes me out of the categories of marriage
Is it 'cause I know what I want just like you?
'Cause I make my own money and my own moves?
Love who I want and fuck who I choose to
Don't take no shit and won't be used

But I guess that makes me undesirable

Arched and relaxed
Oh, touch me like that

Had to get back to ya, back to you
Can't even play it cool

Tell me what you see in me
Gotta be something different
You must be made for me, patience is everything
In and out, in and out, in and out
Arguing, trifling
Difficult, maybe more
I don't know, know why you love me, yeah
You caught it bad, you got it bad for me, babe
And I'm so glad that they can't have this, babe

Nobody else but you
Nobody else could make this move
Nobody else had a clue
What I could do, what I could do
The right amount of love, right amount of trust
Right amount of dick
Right amount of slap me up
I think I'm throwin' a fit
Right amount of roleplay
Right amount of talkin' to me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, hey, oh, oh

Feel it in my heart, feel it my soul, feel it in my bod', my body
Play fair, I gotta let you do, no
Will never fall out of love with you
With you, with you, with you, with you
I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fuss
Baby, I'm trusting you, I'm trusting you, ah
Fightin' on my mind, fightin' all my life for you

You got potential, you got, you
You got potential, you got, you
You got potential (Potential, yeah, yeah)
You got potential, you got, you

Had a few niggas ride or die for me
Tell me, baby, will you slide for me?
Keep the Glock 40, holding it down for me
I know you're good in the hood, bust a couple juugs for me, yeah
When I’m on the low, will you still cover for me?
Blowin' bands to make me feel lovely
When I'm gone, will you still think of me?
I need to know for sure

’Cause you got potential, you got, you
You got potential, you got, you
You got potential (Potential, yeah, yeah)
You got potential, you got, you

Caught my interest, talkin' that shit
So intriguing (Yeah, yeah)
We could go far, go the distance
I could see it (Yeah)
I'm not tryna be out here with my hopes up
If you all for me, then let me know what's up
Don't change up on me in the long run
Keep it open, one hunnid

'Cause you got potential, you got, you
You got potential, you got, you
You got potential (Potential, yeah, yeah)
You got potential, you got, you
 
 
 
What's temporary? Me or you?
You want me here to stay (Stay)
But your situation tells me that it’s a waste of time
But never mind all that, mmh
Boy, I'm serious
You know you don't have to play
I’m already on the way
You ain't gotta say shit
So he set the mood on some love shit
Made a couple jokes about fuckin', yeah
Might've kissed few times but never made a move on no cut shit
Just enjoyed the time that we had laid aside to be numb in

All alone, we turned off our phones all the way
Your girl drivin' your ass insane
And you know my nigga don't play shit (Oh)
I say, "Babe, what we gonna do?" (Oh)
And you say, "We'll have our cake and eat it too"
Too, our cake and eat it too, ah
Ah, yeah, our cake and eat it too, too
Our cake and eat it too, ooh-woah

It's not the right time but
You say the timing is perfect
You want me to ride for you, on you, with you, my babe
You want me to lie
Say, "No, I haven’t seen this guy"
We doin’ the most
Takin' pictures you know we can’t post
Can't post
No, no, no, no, no (Oh)
All alone, we turned off our phones all the way
Your girl drivin' your ass insane
And you know my nigga don't play shit
 
 
 
You said you want love, babe
You said you can give it to me just how I, I need
And you think of roses and daisies
And I think of passion and fire like Hades
You say all the time, peace and quiet
But for my love, I need a riot, a riot
I hope you capture my drift
I said I need a riot
I don't want no sinking ship
But I need...
Better than the typical, "Honey, I'm home" shit
Why we even makin' love when you're tired of this?
Said that you'll be working late for the third time this week
Watch your love go astray 'cause our love's too routine
, too routine
Love's too routine
Love's too routine
Too routine
 
 
 
Trust me, trust me
I don't like being alone
Thinking bout ringing your line
I wish you would come home
But I'm just tryna balance my space
I'm just tryna protect my space (Oh)
I don't really need the pain
But I love to feel the pain
Maybe I could use a break
So we just might have to wait (Oh)

'Cause we're way too in love, just to fuck and let go
'Cause we're way too involved, just to cut and not call

Way too in deep (Deep)
Way too in deep
Way too in deep (Deep)
Way too in deep (Oh)
Wish I could call, wish I could call and go home
(Oh no no no) We can't even let it go
 
 
 
You won't even listen
I ain't even tripping
Fuck it, keep it popping, sipping
I'm tired of fucking talking
When our eyes ain't even locking
Guess I finally got a feeling

That I'm off of you
You, yeah
I'm off of you
Honesty, oh yeah (Oh yeah)

I can't believe it
You've been mistreating me
I wouldn't leave it
Ain't you realize? (Oh, that)
That I ain't got the time no more, I ain't gotta cry no more

'Cause I'm off of you
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I said I'm off of you
You, you, you, you, you, you
Oh yeah, yeah
We ain't even speaking
I don't even care
'Cause you took it right there, took it right there, yeah
And I know I try to keep it right right here
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you stay home and stay out the street
Then baby, you could get me to get back around you
Yeah, I ain't got the time no more
I ain't gotta cry, because I'm off of you
Yeah, I ain't got the time no more
I ain't gotta cry, because I'm off of you
 
 
 
In a perfect world
You're understanding, I'm not a perfect girl
I would drop my fears at the door
I would only bring myself and nothing more
And you let me be, a woman
And you let me be, a flawed woman
You would yearn to hear all about my past
What I've done, what I've did and why
Hear all my sick thoughts
And if I needed to, I could cry
And you would catch my tears
You don't wanna be nobody else's place, no, aye, no
You don't wanna be nobody else's place, to hide from themselves

Shame
And I'm the one to blame

You see right through me
You see through the smile
You see straight through me
You push past the lies, oh
You got it baby
Oh, oh, oh
 
 
 
Even though I don't wanna show emotions
I'm open
Not the type to try and double back twice
But you had me runnin' right back, back
Had me cummin' back to back, yeah
Grab you by your neck, yeah
Tell you arch your back, yeah
Tell you to shut your ass up
Rushin' here real fast just to take it slower
No, I ain't these other hoes and, boy, you let me know, uh

Baby, all I gotta say, nobody get they way faster
Claimin' that you're here to stay, we'll see how it plays, actor
Boy, you say you're done with games and more
We gotta get deeper now
Deeper and deeper now, woah
Wonder how you give it to me so good (Good)
Guess I never had a real nigga from the hood
But you gotta understand, this wasn't in my plans
You tryna get deeper now
Feelings is deeper now

Use them lips, know I like to kiss, baby (Oh-oh)
Takin' trips, had to get away, baby
Postin' pics, all in our business
Ain't no distractions, all 'bout that action, boy
Hope you not wastin' my time
I want to give in but scared to rely
I want to feel, boy, but you ain't mine sometimes
But it can't go to waste
Ain't a nigga who could take your place

Baby, all I gotta say, nobody get they way faster (Faster, oh)
Claimin' that you're here to stay, we'll see how it plays, actor (Yeah)
Boy, you say you're done with games and more
We gotta get deeper now (Deeper now)
Deeper and deeper now, yeah
Wonder how you give it to me so good (Good)
Guess I never had a real nigga from the hood (Baby)
But you gotta understand, this wasn't in my plans (No)
You tryna get deeper now (Now)
Feelings is deeper now

Now, oh, woah
Oh, woah
Yeah
 
 
 
Uh, let's start off with something light
You bringin' the candle light
That I put aside sometime
Tell me what you say 'cause you know I got it baby
I wanna call you, I wanna leave it up
You feel the same, so I know that you exchange this
I need some play boy baby I get on my way, ay

Way, way, wakin' me up
Way, way, puttin' me down
Babe, babe you know how I like it
I can tear it down
Way, way, wakin' me up
Way, way, puttin' me down
Wait, wait, I came to show you something you gon' need, yeah
You know, 'cause you know I know it
(You know, 'cause you know I know it)

Typically not the girl out your league
I know that I'm not just like them other girls
But I can lead you to something that they can't see
Something stable if you trust me, but you won't (Yeah, yeah)
I'm callin' you out to see
You wheeling me in, you
I know what this means to you
And it's feeling right but I-
Slick needed a reason why
I waited so long, but you
Tell me don't fight it, you, oh baby

You always calling 'bout something
You always wanted my way
I gotta catch you on something
You gotta be tired of playing games
I wanna talk about something
I wanna get it my way
I need you here by my something
I need you here by today, yeah
Yeah, but you got it, but you got it
Boy tell me what's my name, boy tell me what's my name

'Cause you hit me with the late night text
 
 
 
Why don't you tell me what she's got on me?
I find it hard to believe that anyone, will love you as great as me
I miss all yo passion wake me out of my sleep
Banging on my door at a quarter to three
You play it safe so I guess you go with her
Without society's outlook on me bet you choose me first
No I'm not the type of girl you bring to mom
But we've got a special bond
You ain't the type of guy I bring to my dad
But there's nowhere else I'd rather be
Than with you, yeah, than with you

You run the streets, you gettin' cash
You livin' life, you spend it fast
I say you run the streets, you gettin' cash
You livin' life and you spend it fast
Just like me, just like me
Hey, why can't we just be bad together? Oh yeah

Tats on my face and you say you're ashamed
But deep down I know you love it, you love
The spark that I bring, the way that I sing, you love it (Oh)
I wear all black and you do the same
You do your drugs and I have my ways
I am a reflection of you
So, your playin' safe, so you go with her
Well guess you'll be bored for the rest of eternity
I know you love me and you know you do
So, that's when you call and tell me it's true

You run the streets, you gettin' cash
You livin' life, you spend it fast
I say you run the streets, you gettin' cash
You livin' life and you spend it fast
Just like me, just like me
How you hate me for being like you baby? Ooh woah
But when we make love, be just be
 
 
 
Slammin' ’em fast at the bar tops
Drinkin' 'em straight with no regrets
Obviously I got a problem
I like the taste

Wanna get wasted with you
Tell me what’s good for me but I don't care
Wanna get wasted off you
Oh ooh, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

What an addiction, so high a cost
Gambled it all just to be lost
But no love lost, no bridges burned
You live and you learn
I learned from my hurt
Show me what I have been missing
Crazy but I will not listen
No good for my health
It can't be when I'm with you, yeah, yeah
Waste of time, my lover
Throw it back and I feel the burn
No good for my health

Baby if you leave I just might lose it
 
 
 
New face, new feel, I know the drill
You got a girl so don't get too close to me
I mean, ain't that how it's supposed to be
Mysterious and distant, true
Commanding, I listen
'Cause everything I was thinking about I rather pursue
You got me, you got me
You got me wanna risk it all
You got me wanna miss his calls
You got me wanna take it off, ooh yeah, oh woah
You got me thinking crazy things
Regretting this but it's too late
I wish you didn't know my name, oh yeah

'Cause when you call and I'm there
Like "Ooh, ah, pull up, hop out, ooh, ah"
When you call and I'm there
Like "Ooh, ah, pull up, hop out, ooh, ah"
Call and I'm there
Like "Ooh, ah, pull up, hop out, ooh, ah"
 
 
 
Young girl in hot Daisy Dukes
You thought you'd have a great night (oh)
You thought with your hot rod and your fast rides (oh)
That I'll just fall in love with you and agree with you to take me home
But boy was you wrong
It's clear to me you think that we are all the same
That I'll be impressed by your house on the hills
And the fame you claim
Telling me what I can't get out of you
What you will do, what you won't do
But I don't need you and I'm not supposed to
Say you never been friendzoned before
Hopefully your ego will defuse poor child
You look so confused
'Cause you've got a reality check
'Cause I got my own check
So, move onto the next who's more impressed
Rid of all your fancy things that don't mean nothing to me
That'll get old but not if you got
A heart of gold

That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh

Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days

And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost

And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side

She's about to earn some bragging rights
I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
Then I'ma be a memory
Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you say to me
I got cups full of that Rosé
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you

Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you

Old rapping ass
Light years past the class
Hit it, don't have to pass
Nigga, we the new Aftermath
Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh
Niggas after fame, I'm after cash
You's a fan, I'm a player
I'm the man, you's a hater
And I only smoke papers
That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd
Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

Do to you

All I ask of you is try to earn my memory

I'm on some gin, you on some gin
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
And these haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

Do to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory

Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
And bitches love me ‘cause I'm fucking with their best friends
Not a lesbian, but she a freak though
This ain't for one night, I’m shining all week, ho
I’m sippin' Clicquot and rocking yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in my watch I can’t tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up, 'cause every nigga that I’m with Taylor'd

Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: "That's nothin'!"
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

Stay high like how I’m supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds can’t get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean, but it's super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks
Get fly and take trips and that's that, real rap
I let her get high if she want and she feel that
Convertible drop feel, ‘87, the top peeled back

Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
You already know what it is, man
And if you don't, you should by now
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: "That's nothin'!"
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
 
 
 
You be anything you want
Just keep going, going, gone, gone, gone
It don't stop here nigga

Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie
All you got your name and your word so never break it
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it
Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun
I was riding in my Bonneville hoping I could make it
Out selling P’s and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters

Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Sayin' fuck the ones who hated, roll one up and celebrate

Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

Roll that weed up and smoke it
Take your bitch home and poke it
Juicy be gettin' so faded
Thank God I got a chauffeur
Only good cali bud
Pulling hoes bad as fuck
Just like a youngin' my nigga
Juicy do all them drugs
Niggas smoking that babbage weed
I be on that light green
Pop molly in the after hours
A member of no sleep team
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself
Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps

You known I’m fresh up off that corner, twistin marijuana
They copy us, they clone us
Yeah we so fly we owners
Got acting like they been before
But they ain't never been at all
8 balls I was in the hall
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all
Champagne when we celebrate
Keen sense so I smell the hate
Middle finger we getting paid
It cost much but don't press that eight
That dotted line it ain't like that day
Comic book let me illustrate
Like power bang when they lift that cane
My cousin died wish I can get that day
Back like it's a vertebrae
Bring that nigga on front street
Talk about and never be about it
They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch meat
So anything you need you know that's on me
And that's OG, I swear homie

Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique
My city holding on to me so niggas holding on their heat
Throwing up their side, rolling up that leaf
All we do is get high, all we want is peace
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking
I'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking
Yeah my niggas dirty crooked I just had to make it on
And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home

Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Sayin' fuck the ones who hated, roll one up and celebrate

Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

Jumped on the road and did all them shows

Promoters call and try and set up dates
Bought the car with that yellow paint
Go to parties now and they set up drinks

And sent it back if I ever seen a seed, man
And you don't even gotta ask

While I'm smoking out the bong getting sucked like a thumb

I smoke so much KK they should've called it Juicy J
Bombay and lemonade, weed get the lemon taste
Never hit the bong, let me demonstrate

Go and roll it, chief and choking, marijuana, reefer smoking
Tried to sell me some under reggie, foot up in his colon
Call the doctor, call the clinic, bullshit we staying with
Your life ain't worth a motherfuckin' quarter but you payin' with it
Khalifa kush a hundred pounds, that's a half a mil
Memphis streets so eat this like a baby, like Enfamil
Lungs full of KK, have your mind on a runway
Blow my high, motherfucker, I'mma shoot up like an AK

My white house higher than Willie Nelson
On dabs the wax is melting
These clouds are smoking, help me, I'm flying like Elroy Jetson

I’m just smokin a trippy stick on this one
OG Hash Oil

Roll a joint, roll another one
When it's all said and done
I'll be at the top bitch
Cause I hustle a lot
Them cars, we pulling 'em off the lot
Don't even test drive it before I cop
Just boarded a yacht
We're at the craps table in Vegas
The dealer saying how he admiring my watch
I'm placing my wager
Don't even care how much paper I blow
Cause I done get this money and stay on
A couple things that I know
I'm blowing that stink by the O
My weed so strong I swear to god you would think it's cologne
I go anywhere in the world and just make it my home
Staying at the highest level but I ain’t make it alone
Now that my money right them suckers keep thinking I'm wrong
But I'm just switching lanes, foot off the brake and I'm gone
If you ain't talking money homie, you can't get a call
Cause this a muthafuckin life that you can't live at all
I'm getting high while I drive, I ain't thinking of y'all...

I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas

Still rolling weed on my XXL
Only difference is that's me on the cover
Once in a while call my little sister and tell her I love her
Cause shit can get crazy in this industry
Most of your friends become your enemies
That's why I stay down with the ones that's been with me
The niggas who started and they down to ride to the end with me
Make sure the positive energy keep flowing
All the weed keep rolling
And all of us keep getting high, the sky
We gonna keep from falling
Niggas keep hating, but baby I'mma keep ballin'
A lot of y'all turned fake, cause you found out what I make
Now I'm buying estates
Going on private island vacations
Flying on private planes
I'm cool with the pilot, he let me roll something
Put on a movie, let my girl watch it
At the dealer, high, lookin' at that Ferrari options
Just an everyday life, when you young and bossin'

I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas

It's a cohesive thing
But the focus is still getting my thing out there
And to have people understand
This is the world that we're creating
And it doesn't exist without all of us

Bitches holding they weave
Rolling trees
With they pretty feets up
Them suckas often imitate
But they can't be us
So super high
Look in the sky when you wanna see me bruh
Cut my speakers up
Drowning out what the critics say, just
Continue to smoke and remain G as fuck
Polo socks match my Polo hat
She leave once, it's a known fact
That she ain't coming back
Now Taylor Gang that

And ain't shit change
But the amount of horses in my motor
When I switch lanes
And I beat 'em blinding
With them diamonds in my big chain
Heavy in the game, little homie

One of my baddest bitches
Rollin' up while I'm driving

Just hit it once while she light it
My game tight, seal and sign it
Them niggas just playing
Ain't really ballin'
Saying they being honest
Claiming that's your wife
But we can't call it
She all in my hotel suite
At 3 in the morning
Taking her clothes off
Inhaling weed and coughing
Ain't her first time chiefing
But say she don't do this often
Since I was 16

Take niggas hoes
And smoke hella trees with 'em
As for your team
You niggas in the stands, you just lookin'
I'm a pro to these rookies
And the plan is still paper over... pussy

And ain't shit change
But the amount of horses in my motor
When I switch lanes
And I beat 'em blinding

Money wall to wall, young famous nigga, spend it all
When you die you can’t take it with ya
Bottle of Rose if I’m drinking with ya
Cause most niggas is broke, they bank is injured
Them bitches gonna ride with who they think’s a winner
And I’ll be smiling in case they take a picture
Oh, I’m smoking weed, drinking liquor, make a hundred
On a show spend it all on my niggas
When I go shopping I tell them pick one
Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision
Always about my business, don’t play the cards
I talked to the niggas who dealed them, uhh
Royal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah

I’m gonna spend it all why wait for another day?

Plus the most exclusive tree in my jar
Making my bank, spending it all

She taking it off, most of these niggas just talk, ain't caking at all
Back in the day money was short, I’m making it taller
You know what I mean, some say it’s a problem
Blowings my greens, not saving my collards
No NBA, they say I’m a baller
Live for today,

Scarface, all out, a-a-all I want in this world

It ain't nothin' to me but it's somethin' to you
Count money like it's somethin' to do
Summertime, I'm like, "Fuck the roof", winter time, I'm in 'Lo boots
And uh, it's nothin', I like bein' high because it's a better view
And, I told your ho my chain so cold, it's on Theraflu, uh

If it ain't money, don't know what the topic is
Don't come out 'til next year, that mean I'm rockin' it
Order thirty-seven bottles, call it poppin' shit
Goddamn, what you on?
A private plane, fuck you on?
Party in south of France when it's cold
Used to rock all that old shit 'til it got old

It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'

The world turning, the weed burning
Them haters talking, I keep earning
Know some who say life's a bitch
Well I’mma keep flirting
Fuck that bitch for the money and Louis V purchases
Old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is
Niggas flexin’ hard with no bars, they got weak service
Keep verses, Mortal Kombat
Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin’ bitch then what you call that
Nothing but net, ain't back cause I never left
I did everything right nigga better yet
Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us
Something like a contracto,r built it from the ground up
Now just, twist up this weed
Realize that you are in the presence of a G
Don’t fuck up my paper meaning my cheese
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees
Fuck it, you know what I mean

I’m riding round, smoking, my music up loud
Gotta do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
I’m in a race, and taking the winner's place
No foot on the brakes
One of the best, homie that's what they call me
It’s lonely at the top, ain't no company so
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own

See me, when I’m alone, wishing they could fuck with me
My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me
But I’m just riding dawg, doing a buck fifty
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and jet skis
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretzky's
My dime pieces only recognize the best trees
Treat ‘em like I don’t need ‘em boy, you best believe
You in her face, I let her breathe
From debated on, to waited on
From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on
Cause we are, young movie stars
Cause we are, young movie stars

I’m riding round, smoking, good music aloud
Gotta do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
I’m in a race, and taking the winner's place
No foot on the brakes
One of the best, homie that's what they call me
It’s lonely at the top, ain't no company so
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own

(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)
(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)
(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)

O-ooo-oh, now I just stunt on my own
Bitches ain't say shit to me
But now they won’t leave me alone
Used to walk the other way
But now they all come to my home
And they calling my phone, cause my paper is looong
Nothing, they ain't singing my song
Get hired up, if they want then I bring them along
We flying up, no you won't need a ticket at all
Need a ticket at all, tell a bitch I’ma ball
And I’ma buy a new crib for my niggas and all
Cause I remember days we’d sit and pictured it all
Nigga swear I’d leave or pictured I’d fall
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I’m a star
Cause we are, young, gifted
Not to mention out here making muthafuckin millions
Yeah, I said it, muthafuckin millions
Got my money up, I’m in the building

I’m riding round, smoking, good music aloud
Gotta do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me

This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

It really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you we a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?

This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa
 
 
 
Is it going? Is it going?

I don't know what you're lookin' for
Oh, yeah, boy, come on

We ain't here to hurt nobody
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

When Timbo' is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple gra-a-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A, way down to Japan
I'm a real producer and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice

We ain't here to hurt nobody

Wanna see you work your body
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling?
I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top
It's hard to hear you from way up here
Now I saw you tryna act cute on TV
"Just let me clear the air..."
We missed you on the charts last week
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
Now if se-sexy never left, then why is everybody on my shi-i-it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run would never be over, not at least until we say

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)

Can't fathom where I'm at, baby, pop another pill
In a whole 'nother realm
If you want to make a movie let me know
It's a whole another film
I suggest you get your dress for the Golden Globes
What you know about Tim
Top down, the Aventador, 4 AM
On the sunset strip
Trying to get high at the sunset, baby don't trip
Hollywood lights, Miami nights
I'm on a motherfucking binge
Just might go and buy a Benz
Or trade a car for your friends
Oh yeah, we playing with them M's

Ridin' down Collins with my entourage following
Just left SoHo headed to the Go-Go
Lap dance for the girls
Let me put her hands on her curves
You ain't about that life, you scurred
Ah, baby, you scurred—like skrrt to the crib
What you know about the kid?
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing

I just got back home, 40 days on vacation
No one killing the game, shit is all for the taking
What the fuck did I stutter? Am I being mistaken?
I'm a s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-star in the makin'
Who you said was the man? What the fuck is a deal?
Really do it the best, I'm DJ Khaled for real
Got my thumb on the pulse, got impeccable timin'
If they forgot about my worth, I got a check to remind 'em
Got some things on the wrist, Cartier with the diamonds
If this was 10 years ago nigga would've went diamond
I been singing and rapping, I make a killin' in both
If I had to choose a Jackson man, I'm feelin' like Bo
Fresh down to the socks, team look like the Raiders
I don't take this shit for granted, I'd like to thank my creator
I'm coming b-b-b-b-b-b-b-back on you haters
I'm 'bout to put this bitch on her back and get back to you later

Imagine straight from work to the plane
Ain't no baggage claim
Don't need to change your clothes, girl, or your last name
Motherfuckers want to act like I'mma call
If you want to be a star, girl you need a co-star
Got some bitches we can call up, babe
Now they want to know who you are and how you got there
Girl, I can try to care, oh, get you out of here
You and all this gold on me
On a plane going home, not as you want
What you motherfuckers know about me?
 
 
 
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say, but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me, then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around
And say (that)

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat, but it's nothing new
Yeah, yeah
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry like the angel Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
Oh, oh
It's too late to apologize, it's too late

My moon belongs to your sun
Your fire is burning my mind
Is it love or is it lust?
Something that I just can't describe (Ah)
Am I the one and only? (Ah)

And when she dial my number, I don't pick it up
Alright, alright, girl, now I gotta catch my flight
Alright, alright, girl, I can't be that somebody every day
She say she';; find somebody if it ain't me
And I'm getting the feeling that she finna creep
(Boy give me a call back) That's what the message said
That shit stuck in my head, she said I never did
(Boy give me a call back) She could be in his arms
She 'bout to break my heart, she 'bout to break my heart

I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low

But if I go out to cheat then I have no standards
Fuck that, tonight I'mma live

Bitches don’t cheat on niggas this rich, bitch, you must be a misfit
I'm drinking, fucking my kidney, you got my going ballistic
Don't tell me you kissing niggas with my favorite lipstick
Not my bitch
Mamacita, no love lost, used to moving them drugs off
When a nigga he-a serve you
They come back and run up in your drug house
You lying bitch, who you lying to, tell me who you lying to
You rather taint my impression, how I look at you, how I honor you
We spent days up, I'm just thinking, did you get laid up?
Talking and conversating, hoping you tell me the truth
I thought I was bulletproof, until I found out a clue
You might be fucking him and him
And every brother around this bitch
I never knew until I thought I knew
He can't fuck you like me anyway, you must be getting back at me
Maybe my mind's playing tricks on me
I'm feeling guilty cause these hoes on me

I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low

Get out, you can't be in here, you have to get out
I implore you, please?.. Please?..
You are all going to die down here...

It's life or death, either one
The king is back, take head and run
I piss and take a shit on your beats for fun
I killed the Game, I ain't even use a gun
Who better than me? Don't make me laugh
I run this shit, they just chase my ass
I ain't talkin' shit nigga just tellin' the facts
I think all the tracks I'm hearin' from niggas is whack
I be hearin' this niggas, what they say in their rhymes
I took my spot, nobody gave me mine
I make the beats, that "Boom Boom Boom" in they trunks
You disagree homie then go on and jump
You can bump your gums, you can say what you want
That's all you gon' do, 'cause you niggas is punk
I'm number one, you ain't nuttin' but shit
When they need a hit, I'm who they come to get
Talk to me

If you got love for me, I got love for you
If you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
We can do it however you wanna do
Nigga, if you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
Go 'head

Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)

Yo
Hey
I'm tired of niggas, niggas is tired
You ain't a G, I see bitch in your eyes
If you're close to me, you're supposed to be
But most you rap niggas is hoes to me
Wherever you from, the question i ask
Is do you think I give a fuck, riddle me that
'Cause in my hood you done been to hell and back
This sinister shit, to hell with that
I seen them come, I seen them go
I doubt if you can show me something I ain't seen before
Who's supposed to be in charge, I need to know
When I shake your hand, I'mma step on your toe
Go get your gun, go get your clique
I'mma be right here chillin' with your bitch
You mad at me, cause I'm getting' rich?
Well Put the pistol to your head and empty the clip

Some is stars, some is lames
How they follow little trends to get they fame?
I ain't snap my damn fingers to get in the game
You claim you rich, show me, son
If you got so many dollars then lone me one
Fools think they're killers they own a gun
When you know you bout as sweet as a honey bun
Trashy broads, behind the bar
Like you tattooed your frontin' heart
VIP bands don't make you a star
Like we really still don't know who the fuck you are
Don't talk behind my back, just call me nigga
Move my heart to the side, make room to forgive ya
If you still wanna hang, we'll come to get ya
Put the rope around your neck, jump my nigga

You're all going to die down here
Get out, get out, you can't be in here
You're all going to die down here

I see you tryna claim her, now I play with her pearls
Try to come at me, with all of my 
Life's a bitch, but I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please

Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50
What a working girl, now work it, girl! Like..

The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breath

No boundaries, we're fearless

In this world that we're creating
Magic's all around
We can fly above the ground

'Cause everybody's in harmony
Harmony

Trouble knocks on the door
With your heart above the floor
Keep shining, yeah, keep trying
If something's wrong we'll be strong
Face your fears until they're gone

In this world that we're creating
Magic's all around
We can fly above the ground

To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
I'm the inside of I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my lonely

I wear scarves and hoods
'Cause they're the only poker face that I've got left
And everything I love about you is a mess
Smash the mirror and break the palm reader's hand
I want to be better than I am

To all the women across the world, we can't diss y'all
We gotta love ya, that's real, uh

To all my ladies in lingerie
Never underage, who stay gettin paid
Who like to take trips where the sun is shade
To my women who love to ball out
And spend all that money 'til ya fall out
I feel like a pimp with a different pimp game
With a different pimp name, with a little pimp fame
I'm loaded with cash, loaded with class, loaded with a lot of things
Even got a gat loaded for that ass
I love my mind, love my soul, love my body
I don't drink or smoke that's why I love my body
You might catch me chillin with a little short hottie
With a little piercin on her body
Yes, I get it poppin, 'specially overseas
Japenese girls even love my beats
They say, "Timbaland we love you
We love the dope things that you do"
Even in London they say, "Tim, we love ya"
They even call me things like wicked, 
and the f'n gov'na
That's why I can't forget y'all
That's why I had to make this roll call, uh

This here's for one and all
It's so good to feel all a y'all, oooh
Make that move and just ball out, oooh
Life's too short for some time out, oooh
This here's for one and all
It's so good to feel all a y'all, oooh
Make that move and just ball out, oooh
Life's too short for some time out, oooh

Back when shorty cherished the thing
Yo' time was frequently saved
For us stoppin and whiskey popping to the Marvin and Gaye
Sonny, don't plan tomorrow but live for today
Sonny, here's a quarter for that groovy arcade
From Cool J to Kane dawg, we changin the game
So graphic with things
Pac-Man ain't looking the same
Haters, get more familiar who you robbing for change
Sebast', 
a.k.a. Tyler Durden's the name

Guess what people
It's the first of the month
Guess what people, I can do what I want
I can take, all my peoples on first class flights
I can buy all my homegirls lightning new bikes
I'm a don when it comes to just servin girls
I'm a don so that's why nobody's in my world
Cause Timabaland's that cool cat
Aka Thomas Crown,
 don't forget that, uh


I'm just tryna find what I need
But I'd rather be smokin weed

Live life to the fullest, drive cars, eat hot food
Live in a mansion next to Hanson

I ain't forgot that I'm from yo' hood
I'm just tryna' be who you would

Cause I hate the game, I hate the glory
I could be with y'all
It would be another story

You don't know all the things I seen
More than fame and his naked greed

They took my cash, take my name
Put it up in bright lights
I ain't got a damn right

Think I'm chilling and living large
Girl he's Mag not El DeBarge

But I'm a be the man in charge in due time
All my P-Town folk getting paid, bottom line

Bought plenty of ice for them shinin' on your friends moments
I'll give her anything she want if it look good on her
And we be chillin' like a bottle sittin' on the rocks
Shoppin' bags full of Cartier forget-me-nots
But money can't buy you love, baby that's a fact
But you can rent some love, with a couple stacks
Man I ain't gotta lease nothin I own one
And every time I hit she say it's a home run
When asked how can we be serious at so young?
I just say I'm in it for the long run

Talkin' 'bout my baby; cause we always breakin the mold

Here we go again, I know all your friends
I can tell they want me, but they gone pretend
I know I ain't perfect, that I won't defend
I say they living single, you gone say I'm going in
You can be my Cinclair, I’ll be your Overton
No offense, I'm noticing, sometimes you go low as them, phone 'em in
I say fuck 'em, you can tell 'em that I'm saying that
If  they know so much 'bout these niggas, where they man at
I'm like damn that, get your man back
Tell 'em sit down, I can't stand that
Watching Martin got me thinking 'bout yo Pam ass
Always blocking, like where yo tan at?
Yeah...

What did I do, what did I do to them
Tell your friends gone with the wind
What did I do, what did I do to them
Yeah...

Love you for life
What did I do, what did I do
Know that they be hating
Girl you would know
What did I do, what did I do

Hanging with your guys, that's why I'm always put off 'til you're done and that ain't no fair
Boy you got some fuckin' nerve, boy you got some fuckin' nerve
Cause you're mine but you're barely around
Do your guys come before me now
If I'm queen then why do you play
Even that's what they say
But how can you blame them
I'm tryna spend some quiet time, but 2k's all that's on your mind
Said your childish ass ain't gone ever love me
What did I do, what did I do to you...
For you to be this petty
Remember how you left me
(Sy Ari: What did I do, what did I do to them)
It just seems like you neglect me
The only time you're here is when we're sex-sex-ing

Love you for life
(Tink: Yeah, right!)
What did I do, what did I do
Know that they be hating
Girl you would know
What did I do, what did I do

They not true as us
I keep it true enough
That's why they keep they eye on you because... they not really used to love
That's why they always at that newest club
They do the most, but they ain't doing much

Hypocrite!
Wasn't you just at the strip club
You and all your single friends throwing dubs, rolling blunts
Guess they ain't much different from my friends
So tell me what's your beef with them

You know me
You showed me true colors
You owe me
And I'll slide through on y'all crew like skrt
And I got you, but they not cool... to me

What did I do, what did I do to them
Tell your friends gone with the wind
What did I do, what did I do to them
Yeah
 
 
 
Hmm, I got a feelin' she keeps me in the dark
I gotta keep my eye on her, she ain't no walk in the park
I bought her this but she want that, she, she, she want it all
You see she wanted to paint the picture and say she my broad
I got a little tip from the word on the block
People sayin' I shouldn't get involved
But I didn't judge or try to change it 'cause you are who you are
I'm like a drug, she's addicted to me, she can't keep me now
She always makin' plans today, come and find me tomorrow
Goodbye, girl

She's too invested in the hours that pass her by
I'd pay attention if I thought it was worth the time
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave
Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance
Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave

I couldn't get rid of shorty if I wanted 'cause she was down
But I was tired of playin' the role like I ain't know that she get around
Somethin' 'bout this girl fascinates me
She's the type that like to hang with the stars
The way she makes me feel and sedates me
Who knew we would take it this far?
Everywhere that I try to go, she got a "Wanted" poster with my face on it
Soon as I walk out the do', there it is, "Wanted" poster with my face on it
Can't blame myself when it's not, my fault cause nothin' is promised
At least I can say I was honest -- goodbye, girl

She's too invested in the hours that pass her by
I'd pay attention if I thought it was worth the time
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave
Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance
Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave


She's too invested in the hours that pass her by
I'd pay attention if I thought it was worth the time
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave
Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance
Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave

That tough guy shit, nigga, that's what I see through
You like a three-course meal, motherfucker, I eat you
You food, and I'm in the mood
So front, I let the hammer fly
Nigga, you could duck, run for cover or die
Your choice, you choose, I pop, you move
Like you ain't shot, you been shot
Nigga, your blood on the street
You up shit's creek, you can hardly speak
You startin' to get weak, your eyes close, your life flash
Your heart's slow, your heart stop, yo' ass dead, you're fucked, kid

I give it to whoever want it, if you want it, come see me
You know where I'm at if you want it, if you want it, come get me
I give it to whoever want it, if you want it, come see me
You know where I'm at if you want it, if you want it, come get me

I'm like Nicolas Cage, Yay' is the Ghost Rider
P89, yeah, I like my toast lighter
Costa Rica to Brazil, I got my hoes in the Lear
While your bitch bald-headed like Britney Spears
I'm in the projects, gettin' dope and piff money
Two more flips, that's Anna Nicole Smith money
Fuck a G4, I'm in a G500, G450, G550
That's airplane talk, I'm the aviator man
Baby AR, shoot your baby out your hands
Spaghetti and corn bread mix got me blunted
This ho talkin' 'bout she don't fuck on a empty stomach
Buy out the mall and hug the block
A hundred thou' woodgrain in a Phantom drop
Then I cruise in the club, got my Rug' in the club
Pay the bouncer a buck, now my uz' in the club, yeah, nigga!

I give it to whoever want it, if you want it, come see me

Dance (Ahh, ahh, ooh)

I don't wanna talk now, I don't wanna hear you scream no mo'
Won't somebody save me? Everything I do feel like it's wrong
All we do is fall down even though we try to stay afloat
I swear it's gon' kill me even though you think it won't
So why rock the boat and make waves?
When everything's calm and okay
So why am I confused if you love me?
I thought this would be smooth sailing

'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
'Cause I am losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow
Our only prayer is all our own
But we need air, we go alone
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow

I don't want to cry, every time we try, it never fails
We change the illusion, whenever you go and set the sail
My heart's in your hand, don't you go hurt me again
All we got is one chance and it's sink or swim
So why rock a boat and make waves? (Make waves!)
When everything's calm and okay? (I'm okay!)
Why am I confused if you love me? (Love me!)
I thought this would be smooth sailing

'Cause I don't wanna let you go
And we're caught in the undertow
'Cause I am losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow
Our only prayer is all our own
But we need air, we go alone
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow

And the water's rising
And the water's rising
And the water's rising
And the water's rising

'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
'Cause I am losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow

'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
And I'm losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow
Our only prayer is all our own
We need air, we go alone
Our only prayer is all our own
We both need air, we go alone
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
'Cause we're caught in the under...
Tow, tow, tow
Undertow, tow, tow

I'll dedicate all my love until you call me baby

Brokenhearted

I'm young, but I'm wise enough to know
That you don't fall in love overnight, oh yeah
That's why I thought if I took my time
That everything in love would be right

But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was saying to love, "Goodbye"

But I guess I'm lonely
Brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

No more empty conversations
Next time I will be totally sure, oh yeah
Don't want the pain of falling in and out of love
It's more than my poor heart should endure

So I'll listen to all advice
And remember each time I cry

That I guess I'm only

Almost made you love me, almost made you cry
Almost made you happy, baby, didn't I, didn't I?
You almost had me thinkin' you were turned around
But everybody knows, almost doesn't count
Almost heard you sayin' you were finally free
What was always missing for you, babe, you found it in me
But, you can't get to heaven half off the ground
Everybody knows, almost doesn't count

I can't keep on loving you one foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on tryin' if you're looking for more
Than all that I can give you than what you came here for

Gonna find me somebody not afraid to let go
Want a no doubt, be there kind of man - you came real close
But every time you built me up, you only let me down
But everybody knows (Everybody knows), almost doesn't count
(Almost doesn't count)

Hey, hey (Everybody knows)
Hey (yeah, yeah), hey hey
I can't keep on, baby, can't keep on tryin'
Everybody knows (Everybody knows), almost doesn't count

I can't keep on lovin' you one foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure
(Never really sure)
Can't keep on tryin' (No, no) if you're looking for more
Than all that I can give you than what you came here for

Maybe you'll be sorry, maybe you'll be cold
Maybe you'll come running back, babe, from the cruel, cruel world
Almost convinced me you're gonna stick around
But everybody knows (Everybody knows), almost doesn't count

So maybe I'll be here, maybe I'll see you around
That's the way it goes, almost doesn't count
 
 
 
And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you, baby
And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you, baby
And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you
And I love you

An angel has always been thought
To be one of God's most precious works
I guess that's how she had you fooled
'Cause she was an angel in disguise
Hurt and pain could never come from her
So you left me only to find that
Hurt and pain involves her
But now you see your mistakes
And now you see your angel was a fake
But my love was never misplaced
See, baby, my love is true
And most importantly, still, I love you (Still, I love you)

An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you

I found it quite strange
The way you said her name
And when you look in her eyes
I see the lust you can't deny
It's more to this than what you said
'Cause in your sleep, you called her name
You say she's just a friend
I knew right then 'cause the rain began, oh-oh

An angel in disguise she was (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But somehow you fell for her (You fell for her)
And though she broke your heart that day (She broke your heart)
And left you in the rain (Yeah)
But still, I love you
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you

She seemed so familiar the day that I met her
Who was she foolin'?
I had a clue what she was doin'
Thoughts of suspicion brought to my attention
I fell in her game, and I'm so lost
Please stop the rain, oh

An angel in disguise she was (Oh, you hurt me, babe)
But somehow you fell for her (Yes, but I'm still here)
And though she broke your heart that day (Still lovin' you)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you (Oh, I've been crazy, babe)
An angel in disguise she was (But I love you, babe)
But somehow you fell for her (somehow you fell)
And though she broke your heart that day (She left you in the rain)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you

And when my music stops
And when my tears dry
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again
And when my music stops
And when my tears dry
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again (Ooh, baby, oh, darlin')

An angel in disguise she was (I know it hurts)
But somehow you fell for her (Oh)
And though she broke your heart that day (Broke your heart)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you (I love you)
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her (Somehow you fell for her)
And though she broke your heart that day (She left you in the rain)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you

I love you
I will never do the things she did
Take your heart and run away with it, no, no
'Cause I really, really love you (Still, I love you)
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you
 
 
 
For your love I would swim clear cross the ocean
If I knew I'll die, I'll die trying
Do anything for your hearts devotion
'Cause I see the god in your eyes
And you'll be the sun in my sky
The star that'll guide me at night
Even at times when we fight
It's alright it's alright oh

I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care

And your loves my independence
You set me free now I'm flying
Above all I can depend on
And you loving me for all times
And that's what I need in my life
And you make the dullest light bright
We can just agree to disagree tonight
It's alright, it's okay

I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care

You gotta know
You got a love you can depend on
In me a trust that our love will grow strong
There's no second guessing
Or wondering if the way I feel is for real
'Cause I'll be your shield when your fighting
I'll be your eyes when you're blinded
My love is eternal, so unconditional
From the beginning til the end

I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
 
 
 
(Hit-Boy)

Only kind of first real love
My baby got them dreams you can touch
And a voice from above
She's a pearl in the rough
It takes a village to raise 'em
We don't do it all by ourselves
I know my smile can be upstagin'
On the stage, I provide like a daddy
And a mother, Father, I give my life
Put that on my life (Put that on everything)

I be up in my comments and I scroll through
A few opinions, you can't do it quite like I can (Do it)
I'm just here to share the light, yeah, yeah
'Cause we gon' be alright, be alright

Baby mama, baby mama
I ain't with that drama, not that baby mama
Ain't dependent on you, I'm a baby mama
Baby mama, baby mama, oh
Whole world looking at me, single mama
This song ain't just for me, it's for every mama, yeah
Every day I breathe, it's for my little mama
I'm every woman and a baby mama

Only hit me when you need somethin'
Pretendin' like you need somebody
I guess you didn't see or
Imagine me somebody

I'm thinkin' maybe I'll just chill tonight
Stomp up in some heels tonight
I'll be in my feelings for life
So you can't M.I.L.F. us up
We ain't a muh-fuh
'Cause we will light you up

I be up in my comments and I scroll through
A few opinions, you can't do it quite like I can (Do it)
I'm just here to share the light, yeah, yeah
'Cause it gon' be alright, be alright

Baby mama, baby mama (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Chance the Rapper)

You not the only one that can take out trash (Ah)
That can make the cash (Ah)
That can make her laugh
You not the only one that can make her brag
That can make her drinks, that can make her scream
Keep a vibrator in her makeup bag
Gotta make it last
Got a little bit of hah, gotta break her back
You already got a strike, can't take it back
Gotta face the facts
As a baby, have a little bit of baby fat
Look, champ
I know it's hard when your baby mama don't want you
'Specially if she don't need you (Ah)
'Specially if she used to feed you (Huh)
'Specially if she used to keep you
'Specially if you used to cheat too
Wait, come to think of it
She ain't never really need you

Baby mama, baby mama
I ain't with that drama, not that baby mama
Ain't dependent on you, I'm a baby mama
Baby mama, baby mama
Whole world looking at me, single mama (Yeah)
This song ain't just for me, it's for every mama, yeah
Every day I breathe, it's for my little mama (Yeah)
I'm every woman and a baby mama (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
 
 
 
Your love (All my love)
Your love
Your love

Sorry for my tardy
Long time I was brokenhearted
Heartache, I'm guarded
A target, goddamn
Ahh, can we let me live?
Can we let me live?
Just 'cause I can sing for you
Sounds like Brandy, candy
I'm as solid as a rock without the boat
Kinda like the goat
But I ain't saving all my love

Laden
Lay my burdens down, down, down
Complicated
I hesitated, yeah
I'm always in my head
Then can I get me out of here? (I'm out there)
Over the rainbow somewhere, somewhere
Aggregated, agitated
I got an attitude problem
Let's resolve it, sorry

Sorry for my tardy
Long time I was brokenhearted
Heartache, I'm guarded
A target, goddamn
Ahh, can we let me live?
Can we let me live?
Just 'cause I can sing for you
Sounds like Brandy, candy
I'm as solid as a rock without the boat
Kinda like the goat
But I ain't saving all my love

I'm medicated
I am free to move about the cabin
Here I stand
Here, take my hand
Hand in hand
It's different
Boy, you's a liar (A liar)
Throw rocks and hide your hands
I'm taking back my hands
Hop in the Mississippi river
So cry, cry me a river
Or walk on your own water, sorry (Sorry)

Sorry for my tardy
For a long time I was brokenhearted
Heartache, I'm guarded
A target, goddamn
Ahh, can we let me live?
Can we let me live?
Just 'cause I can sing for you
Sounds like Brandy, candy
I'm as solid as a rock, rock without the boat
Kinda like the goat
But I ain't saving all my love

You ain't Heaven-sent
Like from up above
Get on your knees, repent
And start saving all
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
I ain't saving all my love

Sorry (Sorry), sorry for my tardy
Long time I was brokenhearted (Brokenhearted)
Heartache, I'm guarded
A target, goddamn
Ahh, can we let me live?
Can we let me live?
Just 'cause I can sing for you
Sounds like Brandy, candy
I'm as solid as a rock, rock without the boat
Kinda like the goat
But I ain't saving all my love

Your love, your love, your love, your love
My love
But I ain't saving all my love for you
 
 
 
Brandy, Darkchild
Mase, get Harlem on the rise
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

I went from Helly Hansen to mini mansions
The girls in Aruba doing belly dancin'
Spent half of my advance on jars from Branson
To make it through my circumstances
But you know I'm wiser now
Move like Keyser now
Got a butter soft leather just to hide my pound
Got a house in the valley, come and find me now
Got enough dough to buy the town
So I might give a six to my chick
Benz to my mom
Crib so big, it look like the center gone
Give her a couch just to spill Henney on
And been a don since Lotto's and Benneton

Some people say that I am not the same girl
They say I think that I am in my own world
What makes them think that I have changed, yeah
A little dough cannot erase my problems
Me, like you, I have to try and solve them
Yes, everything is quite the same, whoa

I'm just tryna be me (Be me)
Doing what I gotta do (Doing what I gotta do)
Some people think that I'm (That I'm)
Just sittin' on top of the world (Sittin', sittin' on top of the world)
I'm just tryna be me
Proving what I've gotta prove
Some people think that I'm (That I'm)
Just sittin' on top of the world (Oh yeah)
Sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world
Top of the world
Top of the world
Top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world
Top of the world
Top of the world
Top of the world (Yeah, yeah)

I wonder why it's often said that my life's
A fairy tale and everything is so right
I wish that you could know the truth, yeah
My life is real, so please don't get it twisted
Problems the same and gotta be dealt with
These are the things I wish you knew, ooh-oh

Always in someone's eye, so many questions why
How is it to be down with me, with me
Afraid to express myself, always me and someone else (I need)
I need to be free, but it's not that easy

I'm just tryna be me
Doing what I gotta do
Some people think that I'm
Just sittin' on top of the world (Sittin', sittin' on top of the world)
I'm just tryna be me
Proving what I've gotta prove (provin, no no)
Some people think that I'm (That I'm)
Just sittin' on top of the world (Sittin' on top of the world)
Sittin' on top of the world

Don't understand why (Don't understand why)
People think I don't have friends (Who knew me back when)
This was my dream (This was my dream, no, no, no)
But nothing has changed
I still do the same things

Yo, we can cut the talking short
If it ain't about cake
I ain't sittin on top, I want a house on the lake
I'm that snotty nosed cat wit a new BM
If you mess wit Brandy, I got to bruise your chin
I be with Puff, the girls be like, "who's his friend?"
If I hit a chick once, she probably move me in
So you gotta tell me right now
Either you wit the cats who make the hits
Or the one that see the chips
(Slow down Ma$e, you're killing 'em)
But don't stop it
What's the use of buying weight
If I'mma have to chop it?
I used a leather lady till I learned her logic
She only mess wit Ma$e, no the money ain't no object
If it ain't Cris, he won't pop it
If it ain't platinum wit' ice, he won't rock it
If it don't cost 60, he don't drop it
If it don't come with TV's, he don't cop it
You can stop it

I'm just tryna be me
Doing what I gotta do
Some people think that I'm
(Think that I'm just sittin' on top of the world)
Just sittin' on top of the world
I'm just tryna be me
Proving what I've gotta prove (Proving what I've gotta prove)
Some people think that I'm (Whoa, ooh)
Just sittin' on top of the world (Sittin' on top of the world)
Sittin' on top of the world

Yeah, yeah, brandy on top of the world
Darkchild on top of the world (Sittin' on top of the world)
Ma$e be on top of the world, what?
Harlem World be on top of the world
(Sittin' on top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)
Brandy on top of the world
DarkChild on top of the world
(Sittin' on top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)
M-A-Dolla sign-E all over the world
Brandy, all over the world (Sittin' on top of the world)
All over the world
All over the world (Sittin' on top of the world)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What, what
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what, what, what (Sittin' on top of the world)
 
 
 
Boy, I saw you soon as you came bouncin' through the door
You, and your mans, and them just took over the floor
Started doing your thing
And it made me notice you even more
The way you turned around and looked at me seemed as though
You must've somehow felt me staring on the low
Something tells me you're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know

I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights

Why is this the first time that I'm seeing you around?
Could you be visiting, or are you new in town?
Yeah, whatever the case
I'm feeling you right here and right now
Your smile and all the love you showing lets me know that you
Like what you see and wanna get to know me too
This could very well be the start of something special
Happy that I met you

I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)
We can dance if you want  (Dance if you want)
Get it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)
Must be a full moon (A full moon)
Feel like one of those nights
I ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)
I ain't even gonna lie (Even gonna lie)
Since you walked up in the club (Walked up in the club)
I've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)
We can dance if you want (Whoa, oh)
Get it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights

I didn't think that I'd come here tonight
Meet someone like you
Start feeling the way I do
Seems like we've known each other most of our lives
After one conversation, this must be right

I ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)
I ain't even gonna lie (Ooh, baby)
Since you walked up in the club (Hey, yeah)
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights (Oh)
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie (I ain't even gonna lie)
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye (Whoa, oh)
We can dance if you want (Whoa, oh)
Get it crackin' if you like (Whoa, oh)
Must be a full moon (Whoa, oh)
Feel like one of those nights
I ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)
I ain't even gonna lie (Even gonna lie)
Since you walked up in the club (Walked up in the club)
I've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)
We can dance if you want (Dance if you want)
Get it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights (One of those nights)
 
 
 
I didn't notice the signs
You covered both of my eyes
(Mix-match text messages, voicemail evidence)
The audience yellin', "damn, she's blind"
Now it's all so clear
And I was also not scared
(Now I know she missed stunt double skipped on it)
Audience kept yellin', "Not the space

I could say that I knew the whole time, but I would be lyin'
You'd have to be a hidden camera, recordin' each take of cryin'
I would say that I would just go to your part, to stop the taping
But the end's here, and I can't change it

The suspense is buildin'
Sittin' on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickenin'
I was hangin' off the cliff, love
You said it's a surprise, what's the surprise ending?

You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
(Guess you kept missin' it, homeboys visitin')
The audience yellin', "yeah, that's right"
And now it's not so clear
You don't know how you missed me
Don't buy you were gone
Stopped goin' through your phone
The audience yellin', "'bout damn time"

I could say that I knew the whole time, but I would be lyin'
You'd have to be a hidden camera, recordin' each take of cryin'
I would say that I would just go to your part, to stop the taping
But the end is here, and you can't change it

The suspense is buildin'
Sittin' on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickenin'
I was hangin' off the cliff, love
You said it's a surprise, what's the surprise ending?

Everything was okay when I was the victim
Had me made out to be so naive
Never knew I was workin' on a masterpiece
So by the time you thought you had me, yeah
I worked on my grand finale, yeah
So now as the credits roll
You're shocked to find out how it all unfolds

The suspense is buildin'
Sittin' on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickenin'
I was hangin' off the cliff, love
You said it's a surprise, what's the surprise ending?

Endin', endin', no
You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
Yeah
 
 
 
When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break has started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
B-Rock, Darkchild
We back
You'll be right here with me
You'll be right here with me

When your life is going too fast off the train tracks
I can slow it down
Just when you think you're 'bout to turn back
Scared you might crash
I'll be your ground

When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break has started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
When your tears have dried from cryin'
And the world has turned to silent
When the clouds have all departed
You will be right here with me

I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeah

When you're trapped and there's just no key
And you can't breathe, I'll breathe for you
The fire's got you down on both knees
And the walls are closing in, but I'll be breaking through
And when you feel alone, I'ma be your home
When others come and go, you know I got you

When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break has started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me (You'll see the sun)
When your tears have dried from cryin' (Cryin')
And the world has turned to silent (Silent)
When the clouds have all departed (Oh yeah)
You will be right here with me

I will be here right beside you
Every step you take, yeah
I will be your strength, your shelter
Shield you from the rain
Oh, when you feel...

When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break has started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me (Right here)
When your tears have dried from cryin'
(We ain't never goin' nowhere)
And the world has turned to silent
(Gonna tell the world we're here)
When the clouds have all departed
(Never, ever departed, oh)
You will be right here with me (Oh babe)
When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break has started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
When your tears have dried from cryin'
And the world has turned to silent
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me

I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeah
 
 
 
Bye bye, bye bipolar
I don't really want no more disorder
Pretty boy in love got both shoulders colder
'Cause you strung me like thread, I was damn near dead
And you fucked with my head like lead, Russian roulette

And I cried and cried and cried and cried and cried
Died and died and died and died alive
Lied and lied and lied
And now I'm high as a kite
So

Bye bye, bye bipolar
I don't really want no more disorder
Pretty boy in love got both shoulders colder
'Cause you strung me like thread, I was damn near dead

Stone cold, love got me hungover
'Cause you strung me like thread, I was damn near dead
And you fucked with my head like lead, Russian roulette

You led me on (To think we'd wed)
Sleeping with the enemy
Sneaking in my bed
You rolled up in my dough
And got a big ol' head

Bye bye. bye bipolar
I don't need no more disorder
Conditional love got me hungover
'Cause you strung me like thread, I was damn near dead
And you fucked with my head like lead, Russian roulette (Oh yeah, you did)

And I cried and cried and cried and cried and cried
Died and died and died and died alive
Lied and lied and lied
And now I'm high as a kite

Oh, you were different
Played me like a fool
All you really wanted was fifteen percent of my moves
You were mute
A fluke with so many needs
A fraud living with me and I see it
One day I woke up
And now my love is unstuck
I can see who you really are
'Cause I'm a star

Bye bye, bye bipolar
You turned me into a stone cold monster
Ill-intentional love distorted my reflection
'Cause you strung me like thread, I was damn near dead
And you fucked with my head like lead, turning red

And I cried and cried and cried and cried and cried
I died and died and died and died alive
You lied and lied and lied
And now you've gotta get out
That's why I lost your ring, and you can keep your last name

Never add your last name to mine
I'm saying never
Saying never

There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time
And I'm runnin' out of things to do to get you off my mind, oh
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face every day

With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me

It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me

Now the minutes feel like hours
And the hours feel like days while I'm away
You know right now I can't be home
But I'm coming home soon
Coming home soon

All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face every day

(With you) With you is where I'd rather be (Where I'd rather be)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
And it's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me (Were here with me)
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, we're so far

Can you hear me cryin'? Oh
Can you hear me cryin'? Oh
Can you hear me cryin'? Oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

With you is where I'd rather be (Where I'd rather be)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
And it's so hard (So hard), we're so far (So far)
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me (You were here with me )
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me

It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me

There's only so many songs
That I can sing to pass the time
 
 
 
I'd rather be kissing you, baby (Yeah)
I'd rather be kissing you, baby (Yeah)
I don't need your extras, just give you to me (I, I)
I'd rather be kissing you, baby (Yeah)

Just call me more, a little
Your voice, it makes me feel better
Why you even tryna ignore me?
Boy, there's other ways to get my attention
Just be here for me, baby, I

I'd rather be kissing you, baby (Yeah, I)
I'd rather be kissing you, baby (Yeah, oh)
I don't need your extras, just give you to me (I, I)
I'd rather be kissing you, baby (Yeah)

You know I love you down deep within
You're my best friend
When we are together, it feels like forever
Ain't nobody like you
Kissing me the way you do
You's a real one, ooh, ooh-ooh (Talk about it, babe)
Nobody in this world is like us two (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
That's why I'd rather

All I can do is sit and think about
The way you used to love me
The way you used to hold me
And the way you used to touch me
And all I want is another moment
I'm waiting, and I'm ready
Touch me

Wish I could hold you just for a little while
Let me
I wish I could see you right now, but you're so far away
It's driving me crazy
I'm missing you, baby
And the way you touch me
It's unlike anything I've ever felt before
That's how I know I am yours

Now is the time to relax your mind
Let go and unwind
I've waited for too long, I'm ready
Tonight's the night for loving you right
You know what I wanna do
I wanna give into you

Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
I can't hardly wait 'til you touch me
How I want you so
Thoughts of you make me lose control
Soon as I see you, baby
I'm gonna ask you for sure
Will you please touch me?

I'm coming to see you
I'm wearing the dress that you like
I'll be on the first plane
I'll call when I get there, I promise
I haven't been sleeping, no
I've been thinking about the way you touch me
I'm losing all self-control
Feels like I'm letting go
And I'm loving every minute

Now is the time to relax your mind (Relax your mind)
Let go and unwind
I've waited for too long, I'm ready
Tonight's the night for loving you right
You know what I wanna do
I wanna give into you, baby

Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
I can't hardly wait 'til you touch me
How I want you so
Thoughts of you make me lose control
Soon as I see you, baby (Baby)
I'm gonna ask you for sure (Ask you for sure)
Will you please touch me?

I'm still here
I'm still waiting
What time are you coming?

Day and night, I'm yearning for you to touch me
I'm thinking of you only, you are my everything
Said I gotta be your lady
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you

Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
I can't hardly wait 'til you touch me
How I want you so
Thoughts of you make me lose control
Soon as I see you, baby
I'm gonna ask you for sure
(Will you please touch me?) Will you please touch me?
Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
And I love it when you're lovin' me
I can't hardly wait 'til you touch me
And you're kissin' me
And you're huggin' me
And you're touchin' me
How I want you so
Driving me out of my mind
Yes you are, yes you are
Thoughts of you make me lose control
Soon as I see you, baby
I'm gonna ask you for sure
And soon as I see my baby love
(Will you please touch me?) Will you please touch me?
He will touch me

Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
 
 
 
What ya hear this time?
Go on and speak your mind
I know somebody's lying
It's always somethin'
Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in
And now the whole hoods buzzin'
He said, she said
Don't let it get in ya head
Baby, don't say
Something that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them you'll see
Hey, we ain't gon stop
They just want what we got

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

I swear they got some nerve
Spreadin' what they heard
I can't give them no burn
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved
That's my word
See, I'm not the one
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough
When it comes to what we do
All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind
We just gon show and prove

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love (You're talkin' about me)
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

Heres a couple of things I can't honor man
How you listen to a girl that still wanna man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Man
I'm wonderin why she ret ta go like Wanda then
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field, runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb
 before you get in a cab
I trade in my cash
Just to take you 
back to last summer,
 man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember I called you Reese's Pieces
'Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around, giggled, said "You so nuts!"
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
Like how ya ex girl get that new number
The rumors was so numerous
For sticking' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love (Let's not talk about it)
When they don't know one thing about us?
Instead they just runnin' they mouths
So all we do is tune them out
I don't wanna hear it no more
 
 
 
One more strike and I'm out
I had to figure it out before I lose
Lose me to you
Feeling like I
Got demons to tame (Illusions)
Maybe it's a daze
Got worse over time
I was always high
I had to readjust
I got the feeling I didn't belong there
All alone here

I've been here before, ain't no secret
Guilt dealt me tragedy inside-ate me alive
I wanted to die
'Til I realized my real life already left to deal with your broken soul
You need you and I need me, too

Chasin' sleep (Sleep)
That's where I can see far
Feel you in only one
Lucid dream, lucid dream, abusin' Ambien
Oh, my Lord, I see a car
Used to write our name in car fog
Loving you, more than me
Ambien

I've been here before, ain't no secret
Guilt dealt me tragedy inside-ate me alive
I wanted to die
'Til I realized my real life already left to deal with your broken soul
You need you and I need me, too

That's where I can see far
Feel you in only one

I guess it's time to say, baby, baby
How you make me feel when you come to mind
I can't keep my cool, baby, baby
I can't hold it inside

I can't wait each day just to see you walk
Trying to move in close to get to where you are

Distraction curves, I took a turn and changed my view
Though I lost but earned
What I deserved is 'cause of you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd rather suffer 'fore I ever let you down
I ain't ever scared to let the truth out
Oh, they won't ever lay me down

Where we going?
We diving in the ocean
The tidal winds blowing
The storm inside is growing
There's just something about you that keeps me floating
You see what's inside, broken, restored it
It's unconditional, these days you know
You are unconditional in every way you love
Love, you gave it to me
I'm blown away to a
A place where I don't wanna be found
And nobody knows my name

Distraction curves my racing nerves, suicide, ooh
Though I contemplate for heaven's sake your help is due (Yeah, yeah)
I know with you
It be all about the timin'
Anxious to find my silver lining
I think it's way beyond the clouds

Where we going?
We diving in the ocean (Ocean)

And nobody knows my name

Used to be a mess
And a hot head
Was self-sabotaging, problem
Fear is my religion, never down, yeah
Wonder why you sent it to me
If you were just gonna ruin it
Jump, I'm falling upward, upward, upward

Where we going?
We diving in the ocean (Ocean)
The tidal winds blowing
The storm inside growing
There's just something about you that keeps me floating
You see what's inside, broken, restored it
It's unconditional, these days you know
You are unconditional in every way you love
Love, you gave it to me
I'm blown away to a
A place where I don't wanna be found

Don't hesitate, holla at me!
What I'm lookin' for is simple, you see
Love and support and sexuality
When I'm with you, I don't wanna leave
I need you just like air that I breathe
But when I'm not with you, I'm missing a piece
I got a lot inside, I need to release

You fulfill my every desire
When I'm with you, you take me higher (Woo-woo-woo)

Medicine can't cure the way that I feel

I don't want to die, I'm only 10 years old, oh
My mama cried
Yellow tape around my body, it's a homicide
And he told me it was accidental, by surprise
Ambulances everywhere and I just pray that I survive

'Cause baby, it's a homicide, oh, a homicide
He just shot me and I dropped down to the floor
He said I caught him by surprise, I caught him by surprise
He was shell-shocked and he claimed he didn't know
I grabbed his hand 'cause I was terrified, said I was scared to die
He just watched my blood spill out and die slow
I looked him right inside the eyes, he looked inside my eyes
Asked him would I survive? He shook his head no

Mind on my murder, yeah, murder, huh, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, yeah, murder, ayy, murder, hey
Mind on my murder, yeah, murder, hey, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, hey, mind on my murder

Yellow tape around my body, it's a homicide
Never thought my day one friend would be the one to take my life
And he ain't even shoot me once, this nigga shot me twice
And I dropped down to the floor and I had teardrops in my eyes
Never thought a home invasion would've costed me my life
All I wanted was a mouth full of golds and my neck and wrist with ice
But now I just got murdered while I go in paradise
Just sing this chorus with me twice

Mind on my murder, hey, murder, hey, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, hey, murder, hey, murder, hey
Mind on my murder, hey, murder, hey, murder, hey
Mind on my murder, hey, mind on my murder

And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just (can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this (enough is enough)
No more walking round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Crying over you

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
That's the reason

I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

'Cause I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here

Much as you blame yourself, you can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love that was even remotely real
How can you understand something that you never had?
Ooh, baby, if you let me, I can help you out with all of that

Girl let me love you

Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you

I would like to show you what true love can really do

Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
And all your trouble

Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer

Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just don't know who you are
Turn the music up in here
I still hear her loud and clear
Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me that she wants to own me
To control me

Come closer
Come closer

And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop

I can feel her on my skin
I can taste her on my tongue
She's the sweetest taste of sin
The more I get the more I want
She wants to own me

Come closer
Come closer

And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop

Come closer
Come closer
Come closer
Come closer

I just can't stop, no no
I just can't stop, no no
I just can't stop, no no
I just can't stop, no no
No, no, no, no

And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
Come closer

I gotta go downstairs (downstairs)
Everybody waitin' down there, for me
But I roll over and 
see
 yo' curly (hair)
Yo' sexy body oh so nice and curvy (Yea)
Reminiscing on last night
Wake up and let me get it one mo' time, before (before, before)
I gotta go I got responsibilities I gotta take care of (Ooh woah, Ooh woahhh)
That's when you wrap them legs around me, and I fall victim to that lazy love (hey)

You got that I don't wanna, that "I don't wanna go nowhere," that lazy love (hey)
You got that I don't wanna, that "I don't wanna do nothing," you got that lazy love (hey)
You got that I don't wanna, that "I don't wanna do nothing," that lazy love (hey)
You got that I don't wanna, that "I don't wanna do nothing"

Damn baby that was good... I'mma hit the shower
Even though I'm about 2 hours... late
But I can't help it man
If they knew what I knew they would understand (understand)
I'm washin' last night off, time to boss up
Then suddenly on my back I feel a soft touch
She right behind me
Water glistening off her body
Lookin' at me like one more time
But baby I gotta go I got responsibilities I gotta take care of (care of)
That's when you wrap them legs around me, and I fall victim to that lazy love (Woo!)

You got that I don't wanna, that "I don't wanna go nowhere," you got that lazy love (hey)
You got that I don't wanna, that "I don't wanna do nothing," you got that lazy love (Hey)

Baby, I got amounts in accounts
That these other cats just don't
I don't mean to brag, so I won't
See but it don't mean nothing
Nothing without you girl

You lookin' better than a Scarface starter kit
All hundreds, small faces, nothin’ counterfeit
You want this ghetto D? Or that over the counter shit?
Catch you slippin’ in the kitchen on the counter shit (damn)
Oh, shit (sup), I guess I’ll pause for these bitches
Guess I’ll ball for these niggas, swear this my last three swishers
On my grown man shit, I’m ‘bout to kill these bitches

Baby, you know I got some money
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
But when I look in your eyes
Baby, you got everything money just can’t buy
All the things money can’t buy, all the things money can't buy
Said, money just can’t buy
All the things money can’t buy, all the things money can't buy

Got a diamond in the back, sunroof top
Got a diamond on my hat and my sunroof off
Her mind strong, but her body so soft
Tattoo on her hip read, “only for a Boss”
She ain’t impressed with the way I ball
She said “You seen one ghost, you seen ‘em all”
Even though that thing cold
She said, “a Rolls Royce, or a Civic, daddy, I’mma roll with you”
She ride for me, die for me, love me, that’s how she do
I pulled up close and I tell her what’s true

Baby, you know I got some money
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
But when I look in your eyes
Baby, you got everything money just can’t buy
All the things money can’t buy, all the things money can't buy
Said, money just can’t buy
All the things money can’t buy, all the things money can't buy

Shawty, where you at? Meet me at the mall
Told her, “let me buy you something”,  she replied, “naw”
She said her love won’t be bought
I don’t need to spend some no money, spend some time, that’s all
I told her, daddy don’t mind spending
I want to see you shine like the diamonds in my pendant
She told me she don’t care for the flash
Want affection, not cash, girl, I ain’t even mad at you
She ride for me, die for me, love me, that’s how she do
I pulled up close and I tell her what’s true

Baby, you know I got some money
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
But when I look in your eyes
Baby, you got everything money just can’t buy
All the things money can’t buy, all the things money can't buy
Money just can’t buy
All the things money can’t buy, all the things money can't buy

What’s happening with it, baby?
Hope you don’t think that I’m crazy
Say me and you, get us some practice makin' a baby
I will take some out the stash and buy you that new Mercedes
Then be all up in that ass in the back of that new Mercedes
You call for the protectin', yeah, send me your issues
They ain’t ‘bout to be playing with her, me and these pistols
See that thirty-six for D’Usse, I’m the provider
Come scoop me in that 458, you be the rider
Oh well, that’s that, back to the party
Bet you niggas anything I’m leaving here with shawty
Got a feeling that she fuckin’ with me for me
She got me feeling like I got a million on me

Baby, you know I got some money
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
But when I look in your eyes
Baby, you got everything money just can’t buy
All the things money can’t buy, all the things money can't buy
Said, money just can’t buy
All the things money can’t buy, all the things money can't buy

Priceless
Ne-Yo, Jeezy
We gone
 
 
 
For the way you changed my plans
For being the perfect distraction
For the way you took the idea that I had
Of everything that I wanted to have
And made me see there was something missing, oh yeah
For the ending of my first beginning (Ooh, yeah yeah, ooh, yeah yeah)
And for the rare and unexpected friend (Ooh, yeah yeah, ooh, yeah yeah)
For the way you're something that I'd never choose
But at the same time, something I don't wanna lose
And never wanna be without ever again
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
So when you were here, I had no idea
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
So now it's so clear, I need you here always
My accidental happily (Ever after)
The way you smile and how you comfort me (With your laughter)
I must admit you were not a part of my book
But now if you open it up and take a look
You're the beginning and the end of every chapter
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
Oh, so when you were here, I had no idea (When you were here)
You're the best thing I never knew I needed (That I needed)
So now it's so clear, I need you here always (Now it's so clear)
Who knew that I could be (Who knew that I could be)
So unexpectedly (So unexpectedly)
Undeniably happier
Sitting with you right here, right here next to me
Girl, you're the best
You're the best thing I never knew I needed (Said I needed)
So when you were here I had no idea (When you were here, said I had no idea)
You're the best thing I never knew I needed (That I needed)
So now it's so clear I need you here always (So clear, so clear, I need you always)
Now it's so clear, I need you here always
 
 
 
Maybe this decision was a mistake
You probably don't care what I have to say
But it's been heavy on my mind for months now
Guess I'm trying to clear some mental space
I would love to talk to you in person
But I understand why that can't be
I'll leave you alone for good, I promise
If you answer this one question for me

I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?

First off, let me say "congratulations"
Heard that you just had a baby girl
If she looks anything like her mother
She's the prettiest thing in the world
Swear that I'm not trying to start no trouble
Tell your fiance he can relax
I'll leave you alone for good, I promise
There's a question I just got to ask

I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?

I know what we have is dead and gone
Too many times I made you cry
And I don't mean to interrupt your life
I just wonder, do I ever cross your mind?

I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?
 
 
 
I can't get it back
But I don't want it back
I realized that
She don't know how to act
Never been a dumb dude, no, I'm not dense
I just had a slight lack of common sense
I was the good guy
She was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl
She thinking me, Earl James and Jimmy
Yep, she had plenty
But love for me, she didn't have any

I was inviting, her into my heart
But she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on

Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)
Trust me when I say
That I'll be okay
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl

I can't get it back
But I don't want it back
I realized that
She don't know how to act
Tried to settle down and look what I get
Thought it was my time, but I guess not yet
She at the bar getting drinks from many men
I'm in the house, thinking she's with her girlfriends
Just not knowing, truly not knowing
I look back now like, "Man, I was open"

I was inviting, her into my heart
But she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on

Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)
Trust me when I say
That I'll be okay
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl

The mistake I made is clear
(We never should've been together)
That's the reason you're not here
(I know that I can do much better)
Not a single salty tear
Not a feeling in my chest
Baby, I'm feeling no stress
I'm too fly to be depressed
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Hey, ooh

Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)
Trust me when I say
That I'll be okay
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)
Trust me when I say
That I'll be okay
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl

Go on girl
Go on girl
Go on girl
I'll be fine

And my watch be filled with mad diamonds
I got good watches, just bad timing
The chick I met at the club was cute
Still feel like I'm getting brain from the substitute
Cause this ain't you and I ain't me
Claim you happy then why you so mad at me?
Can't hold on to what you had, just what you got
You should be here, but you're not

I'm doing it again
What I told myself I would not do, oh
It's 4:15 AM
I'm sitting here drinking, reminiscing on you, oh
And how I used to let you smoke even though I don't
You get blowed then we both get low
As I lay here with some girl I don't know
In the back of my mind, one millionth time
I tell myself it should be you, should be you
Should be you with me, right now
Said it should be you (should be you)
Should be you (should be you)
Should be you with me, right now, uh

As I watch her sleep, all that I can think
She's beautiful (beautiful), but she's not you
Love for just a night, then out of my life (out of my life)
Damn, why can't I do this right when you told me you wanted to leave? (wanted to leave)
I pretended it didn't hurt me (didn't hurt me)
But as I lay here, I can hardly breathe
Laying next to she, when in reality, it should be...

It should be you (oh), should be you (should be you)
Should be you with me, (with me) right now (right now)
Said it should be you (oh) should be you (oh oh)
Should be you with me (oh with me) right now (aha)
(ooh) should be you, should be you baby (ahh)

Ay yo check this out
My life, lights cameras fame and action
Feeling drained from all this private planes I'm catchin'
Willing to trade all the flashy chains I'm flashin for a night
Back for us, exchangin' pain in passion
Romances, kinda like the phantom doors we used to ride
Cause it's tryin' to open up, it's like suicide (suicide)
God teaches lessons every day
You was all I need in life, Meth and Mary J (come on)
The sun don't shine forever
Anytime that we fall, it just means we climb together (together)
Guess we avoided when we couldn't went through
That don't change the fact that it should'be been you

It should be you (oh), should be you, should be you
Should be you with me, right now, right now
Said it should be you, should be you
Should be you and me, right now (aha)
Uhh uhh, said it should be you, it should be you baby (ahh)
 
 
 
Clap for her, clap for her

Clap for her, clap for her
Cause they don’t make 'em like her

Shawty, not the regular in all this
Tell me what you call it
When a chick don’t make decision based on a dude’s wallet
She ain’t in the club acting like an alcoholic
She’s a pretty girl, tipsy
No stumbling and falling
If she leave the club with me
Then her maturity gonna make sure she follow me in her car
She so responsible, she gon' make sure
She leave in time to get home, get ready for work
Or get ready for class, because shawty major
It’s business and accounting, know her mamma proud of her
So for my little mamma, anti drama
So in celebration of you

Shawty, I'mma raise a glass
Here’s a toast to the ladies with class
I see you babe

Saying hey-ey-ey

Girl, the way you are
Cause they don’t 'em make like you no more
Baby girl, keep doing you, how you do
I love the way you move
They don’t make 'em like you, girl
They don’t make 'em like you no more

She a diva
Take a second to turn into a believer
She a fever
In the middle of the July
12 noon in Las Vegas, that mean shawty's on fire
She know what she want
Not afraid to get it, not afraid to have fun
Baby you the one, few and far between
Sexy as they come, swag so mean

I'ma raise a glass
Here’s a toast to my ladies with class

Saying hey-ey-ey
I love the way she make
Baby, I love the way you are
Cause they don’t make 'em like you no more
Baby girl, keep doing you, how you do, I love the way you move

They don’t make 'em like you no more

Clap for her, clap for her
They don’t make em like her no more
Clap for her, clap for her
Cause they don’t make em like you no

Top notch, top floor
4-54, fully restored
Nice wheels, red bottoms galore
Been honest, they don’t make 'em like you anymore
We the hottest in my whip
Give me the promise
We’ll be dancing with the stars and throwing peace signs at the comments
We’ll be posing for the cameras when they bring us on the carpet
Eating breakfast in the morning while we reading the all the comments
Like ooh girl, aww man, y'all see her
Got me like I'ma spend my whole life with you
And make the perfect wife out you
And now the mother of my kids

Oh, everybody raise a glass
Here’s a toast to my ladies with class

Saying hey-ey-ey

Oh, I love the way you are
Cause they don’t make 'em like you no more
Saying hey-ey-ey

You look like you just got off of work
And if I may assume, babe
You work hard but you don't get what you're worth
Am I right?
Let me take another guess
You're a little stressed and I bet your feet hurt
No I don't read minds, babe
I just know what it looks like
When a woman works all night tryna get her thing right

Don't know where you've been
And I don't know what you've been through
But something's tellin' me you
You deserve a drink or two

Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)

Don't know where you've been
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
And I don't know what you've been through
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
But something's tellin' me you
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
You deserve a drink or two
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady

See I was thinkin', over in the corner while I was drinkin'
See you've probably been lookin' for way more out of a weekend
Than freakin' and watchin' the Sun fly so high
But you feel so nasty and don't know why
And you tried all the things that you weren't gon' try
Like kiss body parts if it wasn't on a guy
But your girl's in the bed and it wasn't undivided
And wasn't no inhibition, and everybody wishin'
We'd have did this shit way back then, why we didn't?
Even if you went too far, it's forgiven
You were high when you did it, everybody was trippin'
Promised you'd forget it, but everybody didn't
You're like, this ass doesn't land in the air, body mitten
And I don't just be lickin' on everybody's kitten
But you get in the room and my dick in the room
Make your forget about all the chicks in the room, like that

Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)

Don't know where you've been
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
And I don't know what you've been through
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
But something's tellin' me you
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
You deserve a drink or two
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady

Ain't gon' lie to you, baby
Wish I could take you somewhere more private
Ain't gon' lie to you, baby
Get all in your mind and see what's inside it
Ain't gon' lie to you
I want you, how could I not with a booty so fat?
I don't wanna get on your nerves and test your patience
I ain't tryna do that, no
Ain't gon' lie to you, baby
I would love the opportunity to rub your feet
Ain't gon' lie to you, baby
If you with it, I got somebody sexy you should meet
Ain't gon' lie to you
You had a long night, I'm just tryna help you end it right
So if I may be so bold, can I get you one more to go?

Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)

Don't know where you've been
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
And I don't know what you've been through
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
But something's tellin' me you
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
You deserve a drink or two
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
 
 
 
It's just the cutest thing
When you get to fussing (cussing)
Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up
I don't mean no disrespect
When I start staring
Knowing that it makes you madder (uh, oh)
I'm sorry
But seeing you mad is so sexy

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure
But one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad

Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact
That your attitude excites me
(So exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex
(I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure
But one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad
 
 
 
Baby, don't go
Baby, don't go
Baby, don't go

She workin' Onyx but she say it's only temporary
It's been 3 years and she's still here and I was gettin' scary
Say she don't wanna dance forever
I look at her with my face like, why? Why?
She super sexy, everybody wanna know about her
The one that everybody want, but no one's ever got her
Because the way she get it in, all of the men
Even the women, all try, all try

Shawty so incredible, oh
Body language she's a poet
She's so bad and what's so sad
Is she doesn't even know it
Little mama understands
The way you do the things you do nobody else can
And you could probably get whatever from whatever man
But shawty, do what's in your soul, still it'd be a shame to see you go

'Cause the way you move, ooh
Girl, the way you move
Girl, you got them like ooh
Girl, the way you move, girl, you so the truth
Can't take my eyes away from you
Girl, the thangs you do
Girl, you keep them like ooh
Baby, I love the way you move

Girl, if this club was the sky, you're the brightest star
You ain't playing fair, slidin' down that pole like ooh
What? Drop a couple stacks on you,, that's nothin'
Hundred after hundred girl, a nigga ain't frontin', if you ain't in the club then I ain't comin', naw
She said she tired of all that bullshit
Gon' quit the game, change your life and ease your pain, mm
Hol' up, work so hard it's time to play
Baby girl, take it off for Trey

Shawty so incredible, 
oh, if you want to leave girl
Body language she's a poet, 
ooh, you should come with me girl
She's so bad and what's so sad, 
you're the baddest thing up in here, dont cha know
Is she doesn't even know it
Little mama understands
The way you do the things you do nobody else can
And you can get whatever from whatever man
Baby, do what's in your soul, still it'd be a shame to see it go

'Cause the way you move, ooh girl
Oh, girl, the way you move
Ooh ooh, the way you do
You got 'em going ooh
Just the way you move, 
girl, you so the truth
Can't take my eyes away from you
And the thangs you do
Girl, you keep them like ooh
Baby, I love the way you move

Now, I never felt like this before
Which is why I brought some friends along to help me express it a little better
I got one more friend who I wanna talk to with a little bit more experience in this department
Pain, talk to her

I never seen nobody work it quite just like you baby
And I gotta tell you I'm startin' to like it baby
And it's crazy 'cause you don't wanna be here
I see it in your eyes, your eyes
Stop listenin' to them girls in that locker room
Just keep doin' your thing, don't let it stop you boo
And if you heard some things about me
Girl, they're all lies, lies

Shawty's so incredible
Body language, she's a poet
She's so bad and what's so sad
That she doesn't even know it
The more I drink the more you look like wife material
If you ready to roll with me girl, here we go
You hit the stage and then you make the music stop
Then your booty go, left chick, right chick

Girl, I love the way you move
Got me like ooh
Girl, I love the way you move
Girl, I love the way you move, 
girl, you so the truth
Can't take my eyes away from you
It's the thangs you do

Baby, don't go, ah
Baby, don't go, ah

Oh, oh, oh, woah
To all the girls I've loved before
I, I
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo)

I cannot deny it, I cannot deny it (yeah)
I done broke a few hearts (yeah), done my share of lying
I knew how to keep it quiet, I knew how to hide it
Or if I ever did get caught, I'd just deny it
If my mama knew the thangs I did, she wouldn't like it (yeah)
She taught me way better (yeah), I know I know way better (yeah)
I just didn't care, running round doing whatever
With 3 of they best friends, knew 'em all together

Man, I ain't give a damn, damn
A lot of women had to deal with a boy
That was supposed to be a man, hey
So to the ones I hurt, becoming who I am

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
For every single tear that fell to get me here
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm so sorry, so sorry (mmm, yeah)
For every heart that I broke to get better
Hey, this is my apology letter, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, woah

Sorry to that one sexy model chick
One I used to pop bottles with
One I hit the carpet with
I know I did you wrong
Girl, I know I did you wrong
Can't forget about the one I hit the movies with
One I'm rocking my Louis with
One that did all that freaky shit
Girl, when you play this song
Just say that you'll sing along

Thinking to myself damn, damn
Had to put up with the drama of a boy
That was supposed to be a man, man, oh I
So to the ones I hurt becoming who I am

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
For every single tear that fell to get me here
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm so sorry, so sorry (mmm, yeah)
For every heart that I broke to get better
Hey, this is my apology letter, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, I said I would call knowing that I wouldn't call (wouldn't call)
I said it was all good, it wasn't good at all
I said I was coming through and never came through (never came through, no)
I said it was me and you and it was quite a few
All of the lies (ayy), all the tears that you've cried (ayy)
If I could go back in time (ayy), then I would undo the crime
But I can't, no, I can't make it right
But at the very least I can go and apologize

Well I'm sorry, sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry, sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry, yeah, sorry

I'm sorry, sorry
But I appreciate you, I'm sorry
Couldn't be who I am today if not for what you did, sorry, I'm sorry
Not for what you went through
So from the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry
Thank you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Sorry, yeah, I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
 
 
 
After this song you gon love me for my honesty
Or you gon' hate me for being me
One of the two is gon' happen, but all that I can be is what I am and who I am

Chasing women when I should be recording
Invite a couple then I invite some more in
Next thing you know it's three in the morning and I've only done one song
20k on champagne in the club, then 20k more just because
That's 40k in three hours but everybody watching my section
So it's alright, I know it may sound silly to you
Truthfully it silly to me too, but that's what makes this song so true
(here's the truth)

I'm a little irresponsible most of the time
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine
Especially if your shine is outshining mine
I wanna be faithful but I keep running into dimes
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right
The image I portray you making people judge a book
But if they really took the time to look
Then they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
They would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
So they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
Ooh they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect

I ain't got a condom here, oh no
And too lazy to run to the store
But you just met her three hours ago, says the angel on my shoulder
But the devil he can talk real loud
And of my decision I'm not proud
But by the grace of god I'm here right now healthy and getting older
So it's alright, I know it may sound reckless to you
Truthfully it's reckless to me too, but that's what makes this song so true
(here's the truth)

I'm a little irresponsible most of the time
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine
Especially if your shine is outshining mine
I wanna be faithful but I keep running into dimes
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right
The image I portray you making people judge a book
But if they really took the time to look
Then they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
They would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect

I do a lot of stupid shit
Hoping I never have to pay for it
It's like I've become more of an idiot
With every extra million I get
I thank god for my family and my crew cause I can be a lot to put up with
Much love to the people that don't mind the cracks in Mr. Perfect
(now let it marinate)

They could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
Ooh you can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
You could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
Said you could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect

And in the end they all learned a valuable lesson
Perfection, it's just glorified opinion
When in the grand scheme of things it's our imperfections that truly make us perfect
So do yourself a favour, find the beauty in your cracks
Enjoy the album
 
 
 
Close the doors
Lay down
No, no, no, not like that
Like this
Yeah, I like that
OK, now here's what I want you to do
I want you to look me right in my eyes
And I want you to tell me, exactly, what you want me to do to you
You ready?

Your body whispering from under the sheets
I hear it moaning begging loud and clearly
I'm rather fluent in the language it speaks
But it's your mouth I want to tell it to me

Girl, why don't you
Tell me what you want me to do to you
Say it, say it, say it
Girl, why don't you
Tell me what you want from me
Girl won't you
Say it, say it, say it

It's not as if I'm not totally aware
That you want my hands right here and my mouth right there
Girl, don't play shy, show me how bold you can be
Open your mouth and tell me where you want me

Girl, why don't you
Tell me what you want me to do to you
Say it, say it, say it
Girl, why don't you
Tell me what you want from me
Girl won't you
Say it, say it, say it

Tell me what you want
Oh, you want that?
Say the word
Turn around

Anything that you want, baby, tell me you want it
I got it babe
(Tell me what you want)
No more hoping and wishing
Name your position
I got it, babe
(Tell me what you want and I got it, babe)
Anything that you want, baby, tell me you want it
I got it babe
(Tell me what you want)
No more hoping and wishing
Name your position
I got it, babe
(Tell me what you want and I got it, babe)

Girl, why don't you
Tell me what you want me to do to you
Say it, say it, say it
Girl, why don't you
Tell me what you want from me
Girl won't you
Say it, say it, say it
 
 
 
All my life
And the hereafter
I've never seen
Seen one like you
You're a knife
Sharp and deadly
And it's me
That you cut into
But I don't mind
In fact I like it
Though I'm terrified
I'm turned on but scared of you

She's a monster
Beautiful monster
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind
And I need her
Said I need her
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind

No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind...)
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind...)
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind...)
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind...)

In her eyes
There's love and fire
In my heart
She's burning through
But I don't mind
In fact I like it
Though I'm terrified
I'm turned on but scared of you

She's a monster
Beautiful monster
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind
And I need her
Said I need her
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind

No I don't mind
Playing with my heart
And she's playing with my mind
And I don't mind I don't I don't mind
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) And I don't mind
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) Said I don't mind
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) And I don't mind
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) Beautiful monster

She's a monster
Beautiful monster
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind
And I need her
Said I need her

Style of your hair, shape of your eyes and your nose
The way you stare, as if you see right through to my soul
It's your left hand, and the way, that it's not quite big as your right
The way you stand in the mirror, before we go out at night

Our quiet time
Your beautiful mind

They're all part of the list
Things that I miss
Things like your
Funny little laugh or the way you smile
Or the way we kiss
What I notice is this
I come up with
Something new
Every single time
That I sit and reminisce

The way your sweet smell, lingers when you leave the room
Stories you tell, as we lay in bed, all afternoon
I dream you now, every night, in my mind is where we meet
And when I'm awake, staring at pictures of you asleep

Touching your face
Invading your space

They're all part of the list
Things that I miss
Things like your
Funny little laugh or the way you smile
Or the way we kiss
What I notice is this
I come up with
Something new
Every single time
That I sit and reminisce

You'll live in my
Memories
Forevermore
I swear
You'll live in my
Memories
Forevermore
I swear

They're all part of the list
Things that I miss
Things like your
Funny little laugh or the way you smile
Or the way we kiss
What I notice is this
I come up with
Something new
Every single time
That I sit and reminisceIt's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Ooh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Feelin' like I'm fresh out; Boosie (Boosie)
If they want the drama, got the Uzi (Uzi)
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship (Cruise)
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies (Movies)
Ride with me, ride with me, boss (Boss)
I got a hard head, but her ass soft (Soft)
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

You ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby, go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you, you know
So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
Too much convo for 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So, you don't ever hurt nobody
Baby girl, work your body, work your body

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi
Why not?

Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Pull up in the old school, boy I'm on some new shit
Red to the head, man we gettin' all that
And shorty phone answers, she don't ever call back
And I can see why these niggas hate me
Pull up in a drop and the watch 80
Pull up to the front but a nigga faded
Got a new crib and the shit gated
Came from the bottom, watch a nigga ball out
Drink it to the head, smoke 'til you fall out
Countin' up this money, nigga, keep the door locked
All my niggas gettin' to this money, no lie

Got a good thing goin' with a bad bitch
You know who to call when you need it
Wish I had another you, I'm greedy
Sometimes like that nigga get greedy
God damn I fell in love with a bad bitch
You know that every time you leave me
Even though I know how men be talkin'
I just know that nigga wanna be me
Came in here and fell in love with a bad bitch (Yeah)
Back then she ain't have shit
Now she grown up, she got ass, tits (Yeah)
Wanna know where she got that ass at
She hit my heart, a toot, toot on it (Yeah)
She got a dump truck, I put a boot on it
Don't mind spendin' this loot on it (Yeah)

Oh, you here, baby, yeah

Shawty in the way, got the mothafuckin' fix, yeah
Sippin' all day got me leanin' off the kickstand
House on my neck, 'nother house on my wristband
Girls really love me like a mothafuckin' six pack
No time for restin' (restin')
My life's invested in bein' a fuckin' legend (legend)
An icon, tryna cement it ('ment it)
I'm treatin' every year like it's game 7 (game 7)
I feel like problems in my city been deaded (deaded)
I feel like me and my niggas are unthreatened (threatened)
My new girl hate it when I'm always spendin' (all the time)
I guess I gotta get used to it 'cause of my exes
But it's true, though (but it's true, though)

In these streets, gotta read between the lines
Room, room full of ether clouds, you don't want no smoke

Only the red in my eyes see where you come from
We, we the gang, either you run with or run from

Daddy will pay the cab, maybe stay for a day
No one got it but me
Bitches, they call me whore, son, more buns
Mami bent over for hum
Give her, what she want and let her get it good
Put it on her tongue
Told me, "Charly, boy you gotta give
Fix me with a lot of dick
Hit me with a lot of kick
Show me you the man"
Bustin' quickies and dippin'
That be somethin' I can't stand
Other plans, baby, had of late
Tried to put me in a twirl like the Cheerio
I ain't talkin' cereal
Put me in a video, I can make a wave
Baby girl, comin' home and you can't stay, oww

Ooh, he do it better, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)

I 
can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
(Yeah)
No matter how many times I've tried to you
I can't lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I never lied to you (Uh) I can’t
(Can’t lie y’all, he disrespected y’all)
No matter how times I’ve tried to you
I can't lie to you, I can’t lie to you, I can’t
Always on my mind, 
I can feel it now

I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
No matter how much I’ve tried
No matter how much I’ve tried
Can’t lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
Uh, no matter how many times I’ve, uh

Eh, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
I can’t figure it out
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah

Coming from the back block, posted like the backdrop
Rags to the riches, got rich and bought the ragtop
Lot of homies died here, look at what the grind did
Put me in the same shoes, still do what Shyne did
More digits, more bitches, more riches
They don’t want no broke niggas
But don’t call them gold diggers
I don’t know, I don’t know, why I ain't get the picture?
Why Cosby slipped her?
Why I fucked ‘em both when they said they sisters?
Why Eazy ain’t have the Magic?
Why AI never won a 'ship?
And why God took Max and Chinx
And he ain’t take me when I got hit?

I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
No matter how much I’ve tried
No matter how much I’ve tried
Can’t lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
Uh, no matter how many times I’ve, uh

Eh, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
I can’t figure it out
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah

Beyond Pérignon, the fame, the money
The Baccarat crystal that’s hanging from the ceilings above me
Hearing people whisper, screaming I’m lucky but trust me
Nothing come free, shawty tried to keep my son from me
Or I could be delirious to take life serious
Remain single forever, can’t wife nothing, period
I’m a G, I need privacy, media’s never kind to me
Niggas beefing on small time things, we on a dying spree
He disrespected y’all
Just like a nigga, go figure
He talking reckless, yo
I can’t accept it, yo
No matter how much I’ve tried
For the love of my people, I guess I'll let it go
I can’t figure it out

I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
No matter how much I’ve tried
No matter how much I’ve tried
Can’t lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
Uh, no matter how many times I’ve, uh
No matter how many rhymes I’ve, uh
I got it all in my mind, ah uh
I got it all in my mind, ah uh
Always on my mind
Eh, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
I can’t figure it out
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah
 
 
 
You know
It’s kinda fucked up but
It’s kinda like you’re born to lose, you know what I mean?
Steady young, get your own nigga
Coke boy
Montana

You already know that
All this money I be staring at
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at
Bring your love baby, I’mma bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby, I’mma bring my pain
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at

I don’t know what’s worse
To never get it
Or get it and lose it
You know what I mean? it’s sanctuary baby
You know they say
It’s the game of life
And you don't get to play it twice
Juuheard?

A car, big mansion in the bezel
Tryna make a deal with the devil
I want it all
Born to lose, ain’t it?
Rules in engagement
Glued to the pavement
Sell it all
My first flip was when the needle hit my vein
Lost it all is when the drugs fixed the pain
Pray for me tatted on my neck
Fuck money, I was dying for my respect
I was high getting wet
Was a way of life
Stranded on the block
Fiends buying worth, only thing in sight
Had to pay the light
Mama working 3 jobs,
 
father leaning, he high
My home boy on the run, he hot
Montana!

You already know that
All this money I be staring at
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at
Bring your love baby, I’mma bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby, I’mma bring my pain
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at

Head shot, didn't die
God got a plan for you
Bounce back, hit the block
OG got them grams for you
Did it on your own, nobody gave a hand to you
Now you hot, spitting bars, shows 30 grand for you
God protect the child that can hold his own
Almost lost it all for everything he own
Put that on everything
Thought I knew it all but I ain't know anything
Did it with my dawgs, Had to get my weight up
Pick the K's up
100 round homie lift your braids up
Never put my legs up
I’m working now, it’s working out
They wonder how
Hundred miles running nigga gunning till the sun is out

You already know that
All this money I be staring at
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at
Bring your love baby, I’mma bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby, I’mma bring my pain
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at

Pull up in a boat, titanic La Marina
Shout out to young gunner, spend a hundred on my timer
Looking through the smoke and mirrors, smoking marijuana
'Rari and the 'Gatti and the Bimmers and the Benzes
Homicide tryna knock my door off the hinges
Riding with some cubans that be fresh up out that border
Making back a whole thang, breaking down a quarter
Drophead, getting dome, riding through New Orleans
Hear them shots ringing then I hit that money caller
Counting up my blessings, counting money keep a dollar
Drophead white mink on when it's cold out

Oh me, oh my my

Forty knock his head off (off the rip)
Drop top V, niggas sped off (off the rip)

Talking 'bout mi casa, you TMZ niggas gossip

Off the rip, off the rip
Off the mothafucking rip, boy
 
 
 
Fuck all that ho shit
Fuck all you fuck boys
Bitch, we're real hustlers
Get money...
It's We The Best music, Bad Boy, Coke Boyz

I got my gun on me, I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me, death row Jamaicans, murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight, fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight, I've got my gun on me

It was murder she wrote, your name in blood
When the love's gone, your eyes diluted full of blood
Six cars full of goons, six blocks heard the boom
Dreadlocks, middle of June, head shots, get tombed
Stone, ten shots, five gone, 9/11 dial tone
You want it all, die alone
A war's going on nobody's safe from
Now we're talking to the judge when your day come
Like it was hard not to kill these niggas
It was like a full-time job not to kill these niggas
Eight figures, need the eight story mansion
While I'm strapped up two-stepping with the devil dancing
Diluted with blood in my eyes
Like a stillborn, niggas won't make it out alive, nigga

I got my gun on me, I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me, death row Jamaicans, murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight, fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight, I've got my gun on me (Ace Hood!)

Fuck it, I'm ready to die tonight
Put it on mom with that clip on my back and I loaded it twice
Just a call away, my niggas is ready, no matter the price
Playing with mine, you niggas could get it including your wife
Isn't life a motherfucker?
Since seventeen that pistol's been my blood brother
Sleeping with that lethal weapon, playing Danny Glover
AK40, own a hundred if we're talking numbers
Riders' fucking with mobsters
Niggas want beef? Turn them to pasta
Load up the clip, shoot up your master
Bang bang, bless them father
Passed beside him, rest aside a lake
That's swimming with snakes inside
Look at my eyes, I hate disguises
Knife or gun, I compromise it
Oh Lord, I'm a ride on my enemies
If I die tonight, I bet them gangsters remember me
Nigga, until then...

I got my gun on me, I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me, death row Jamaicans, murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight, fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight, I've got my gun on me

From the depths of the sea, back to the block
With a bitch on my dick and a bottle of Ciroc
Tick tock, non-stop, blocker, blocker, blood clot
Don't test the lion cause you'll get dropped on the spot
Lick shot, drip drop over the soil
Pot's hot until it boils
To this Crip shit, I'm loyal
Dip with us, ride with us, slide with us, sleep with us
Sit with us, fuck with us, bad lil bitch’s better get with us
She likes the French tip nails that I wear
And how I'm so pimped out with dreads in my hair, yeah
You got truth, now the truth is to dare
Blue bandana, it's me and Montana
At the Tropicana with Tanehsa, Alisha, Lakesha, Savannah
Nicknames for my blammer

I got my gun on me, I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me, death row Jamaicans, murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight, fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight, I've got my gun on me

The smell of blood in the bathroom
Body layed out stiff full of stab wounds
I told this nigga I was coming back
Pussy must not have heard when I told him that
Nigga, it's eye for an eye
A life for a life, a body for a price
I want to smell his last breath took
And look him in the eyes and make for sure he knows how death looks
Because I'm him, it's in the air, I can feel it
Shot him four times with the gun I was concealing
Overkilling, it ain't no coming back from it
Then walked away with a demeanour like I just done it
Something evil this way's coming
For big face hundreds this bitch gets punished

I got my gun on me, I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me, death row Jamaicans, murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight, fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight, I've got my gun on me
 
 
 
Penning these lyrics from a hammock
With an ounce of kush, a pack of bamboos
And an ice cream sandwich, I'm that dude
Game given to you from an OG point of view
Usually I'll sell it, but I got enough to share with you
Baby, if you cook and roll that weed, I'll be so happy with you
Fuck you so good, you'll know I'm cheating, it won't matter to you
You know how daddy do you, Spitta make them jet maneuvers
Hop out the club, don't park valet, won't get a chance to move it
I'm out before I hear the music, that's how quick them hoes be choosing
I don't call it, pussy be crawling to me
Homeboy, I don't know who did what, cause I was in the cut
Rolling tropical, sitting low as possible

Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
(Sample: Without any sun, lotus blossom don't cry)

Shorty pussy be the meanest, I be balling all arenas
Homie high somewhere in Venus, I mean this
When I tell you that I want it, I don't need it
They be nulling the procedures, shorty yelling from the bleachers
Got me reaching like a two guard, too hard, ski mask or a suit on
Five chains, canaries help me cool off, tuned off
Camaro like Larry Flynt, block-star, rockstar
Montana Aerosmith,
 forty spit
Homie niggas dying, I'll be flying out
Feds on my nigga's tail, he hiding out, Montana sliding out
Baby, don't be fucking with my high, suck a nigga dry
I'll be low as possible, trying to clear my mind
Montana, bitch

Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
 
 
 
I pray to God I ain't ever dying broke

Ooh devil wants my soul
Self made millionaire! no nigga I owe
Made it out that hole, now watch a nigga ball

High School to the Pros, ballin like Lebron
Hood got young niggas stressing, going bald
Came up I was poor, now Rosé I pour
And I ain't scared of shit just a nigga dying broke

I pray to God I ain't ever dying broke
If I ever owe you, you ain't ever going broke

You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?

Made it lost it came back flipped it
Always faded, lifted
Hit that corner whipped
Hit the dealer, whipped it
Always on it, mind your business
I'm always high, the sky ain't the limit
Ball like Melo, cars all tinted
Chain black and yellow, Pittsburgh Steelers
Sport it knocked it tossed it flipped it
Took my flow and switched it, took my dough invested
Your whole life is scripted
All we do is party, drinkin', molly raggin', shawty raggin'
Money come retarted huh, press the button start it up
Tryna be a dope boy ridin' with a coke boy
Strap with the low boy 50 for a show boy
Niggas made it rain I made I it snow boy
Started with a dollar and a hope boy
Now a nigga hot got millions in the bank
Crib on the water spend a milly on the tank
Montana piece look silly on the link
Montana and Wiz spend millys on the dank

You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?

Smoking weed in my expensive car
I'm ridin' high I'm flyin' high
Told you niggas say the shit you want
So don't even take the chance or try to try my guy
Designer sayin' supplies gettin' low
Weed man say it's kinda dry
Potty mouth, rockstar, at the top and still tryna climb
Drop the top sit back recline
Hundred-K that's just the ride
Fifty-K that's just the change
Thirty-K that's just the time
Tour came that's just in time
That's more racks, that's more racks
Private plane you know that's flyin'
I'm boardin' that I'm boardin' that
Rollin' up smoke roy ridin' with the coke boy
Smoking on strong pack hit it once choke boy
When I'm on the road bottles like dope boy
When the police come, I don't really know boy
Half a pound in seven days that's smokin'
If you ain't bout your family or getting bread you jokin'

You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?

Pick up the pace, turn up the bass
I'm singing this right in your face
I made the call forgive me
Cause I did this all for you
So whether you do or whether you don't
This gon' bang and this gon' bump
Hit your J or split your blunt
DPG then we turned up
Blue bandana,
 French Montana
All around the world first class
VIP, bubble bath
Touchdown, two points
Wide reciever Khalifa bless me with two joints
They told big dick Dogg, he gotta get up on this hit dog
Turn it up let me hear the beat for a second
Have a few puffs then I breathe on the record
Then we go like merri-go, round and round
This right here is for the underground
I wonder how, I break it down for you

You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do

Shorty got potential I could be her sponsor
Met her back stage at a Summer Jam concert
Hair like Rihanna, shoe game was awesome
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller shot caller
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller shot caller

Dippin in the 'Lac (Slow), three in the back (Oh)
Two if ya fat (Aha), pimpin' is a fact
Fresh up out the street, hot jump to the top
I be French Montana from da da da block
Went solo on that ass, sold it on the ave
All white navy blue polo with the hat
I go "rawr" (Rawr) like a thunder dragon
From the South Bronx home of the original clappers
Just another case diggin' in the crates
Empty out the tool they was fillin' it with hate
Living life fast, guess mine's on a speed boat
Smoking weed like it's legal

Shorty got potential I could be her sponsor
Met her back stage at a Summer Jam concert
Hair like Rihanna, shoe game was awesome
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller shot caller
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller shot caller

Back on the scene, crispy and clean
LV the logo, even on the chain
Dopey funny style with a funky funky child
I do it Frenchy style, I let the money pile
She ain't wanna talk 'til she seen the top off
Call me pimp homicide, let her jump off
Feel the texture Rumble on Webster
Stand on my own not who I stand next ya
Can I hit it in the morning? (Mornin') Fo' sho' I'll be pimpin' like a pro
All the bad bitches know when the money hit the floor
Better pick it up (Pick it u,p pick it up, pick it up)
French Montana, French, French Montana

Shorty got potential I could be her sponsor
Met her back stage at a Summer Jam concert
Hair like Rihanna, shoe game was awesome
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller shot caller
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller

I heard you were trouble and you heard I was trouble
But your name is a wave washing over me
No games, just a slave to you totally
Cause I don't care what they say about you Virgo (I don't care!)
And you don't care what they say about me Virgo
But you know what they say about trouble

Pull me down if you want to and I hope that you want to
Cause I wanna be your man and I wanna say it loud
You can show me where trouble goes
Tell me secrets only trouble knows
Cause you wanna be my girl and you wanna say it loud

Went and got a hustle, put a muscle on it
Went and got a grip and put a muzzle on it
Nigga in that paint, I'm Bill Russell on it
Mulsanne with everything custom on it
Number one hits, got every bitch touching on him
Price of fame you lose your brain when you touch it, don't ya?
Nigga, all that change ain't changed me
Cause my body full of lean tryna stay sleep
I done came up that black hole
And I popped up in that black robe
BET awards, Versace black robe
Four heaters up nigga that's a hot stove
Illuminati for that new Bugatti
Self made, who they ask when they ain't got it
Ten-mill' shield for this holy war
Catch chills, your own nigga
Kill you for this brick of raw

I want you to know that I've got your back
Even when the whole foundation seems cracked
Two punk kids up against the world
Yeah trouble, there goes trouble
We could be king and queen of the moonlight
Two young lovers and when the mood's right
You'll hear me say I want you
To pull me down if you want to

Don't bring your chair over here, nigga
Can't get a seat if you ain't bring nothing to the table, nigga
They say you can stand dolo, if you believe in something
Tell 'em: "fuck 'em all"

I'm riding dolo, knock the horse of your polo
Life's a bitch and your sister with Manolo
When your right hand done changed on you
And got your left hand grippin' things on it (paow!)
Dope boy dreams, mansion and a Lambo
And all you get is cases lawyers can't handle
This grandaddy got me candid channels
Clean them bullets, loading choppers, grippin' handles
Bumpin' Roc-A-Fella, duckin' Rockefeller law
Beats from Rico Love, or a hundred from a RICO law
And all the blessings couldn't stop a bullet
When they creep on him, ski mask, black hoodie
LaFontaine by the post office
Hit him in the brain for a closed coffin
For a grand my lil man blow his nose off him
Hundred hit him, paramedics ripping clothes off him

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
I still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
I still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
 
 
 
Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a pay check
Runnin' back to the strip club
I'm never goin' back, never goin' back
No you can't make me
Never goin' back, never goin' back (Nah)
They'll never take me
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've heard enough of shitty news

Love dirty men alike

It's still love, still love (Still love), still love
It's still love, it's still love
Nothin' but love for you (Nothin' but-)
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but-)
Nothin' but love

You love me, you love me, you love me

Got a shift at 10 AM (Yeah)
Gotta dip at 10 PM (Nah)
Gotta get that cash
Won't get past a lunch break
I ain't had a smoke break
In about two days, don't break (Ugh)
Been about three years since I dated you
Why you still talk about me like we together?
I moved on for the better, you moved on to whoever
I was down for whatever, and then some
You gon' make me late to work again

Ooh
Better day than yesterday

Heartbeat make me feel young again (Like a, feel like a…)
Can't beat 'em, just join the party (Let me join the party)
I don't wanna, don't need nobody (Ooh)

All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talking a lot, sorry I'm faded
Think I've forgot, you love me
You love me, you love me

You love me
You love me
You love me
 
 
 
Need you for the old me, need you for my sanity
Need you to remind me where I come from
Can you remind me of my gravity?
Ground me when I'm tumblin', spiralin', plummetin' down to Earth
You keep me down to Earth
Call me on my bullshit
Lie to me and say my booty gettin' bigger even if it ain't
Love me even if it rain
Love me even if it pain you
I know I be difficult
You know I be difficult
You know it get difficult too

Open your heart up
Hoping I'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
And hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me
You'll never love me but, I believe you when you say it like that
Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?
Oh, I believe you when you say it like that
You must really love me

For real, I'm not playing no games
Boy, we back and forth

In case you call my phone one more 'gain
Got no panties on

I know you'd rather be laid up with a big booty
Prolly hella positive 'cause she got a big booty (wow)

You know I'm sensitive about havin' no booty
Havin' nobody, only you, buddy
Can you hold me when nobody's around us?

Open your heart up
Hoping I'll never find out that you're anyone else

If you don't like me, you don't have to fool with me
You don't have to talk about me or treat me mean
I don't have to treat you mean
I just stay out of your way
That's the way you work that one
 
 
 
Why is it so hard to accept the party is over?
You came with your new friends
And her mom jeans and her new Vans
And she's perfect and I hate it
Oh so glad you made it
I'm so glad you could come by
Somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt
Let's start the Narcos off at episode one
Bring the gin, got the juice
Bring the sin, got that too
Won't you just shut up, know you're my favorite

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

I get so lonely, I forget what I'm worth
We get so lonely, we pretend that this works
I'm so ashamed of myself think I need therapy-y-y-y
I'm sorry I'm not more attractive
I'm sorry I'm not more ladylike
I'm sorry I don't shave my legs at night
I'm sorry I'm not your baby mama
I'm sorry you got karma comin' to you
Collect your soul, get it right

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah

That is my greatest fear
That if, if I lost control
Or did not h
a
ve control, things would just, you know
I would be… fatal

I'm writing this letter to let you know I'm really leaving
And no, I'm not keeping your shit
Heard you got some new homies
Got some new hobbies
Even a new ho too
Maybe she can come help you
Maybe she can come lay do after we're done
What's done is done
I don't want nothing else to do with it
Let me tell you a secret
I've been secretly banging your homeboy
Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?
Why am I so easy to forget like that?
It can't be that easy for you to get like that
Oh no, she didn't, ooh yes, I did
Oh no, she didn't, I'll do it again

Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, but I need you

Ooh, just get a load of them, they got chemistry
All they could say, we like brother and sister
Look so good together
Bet they fuckin' for real, and they was right
That's why I stayed with ya, the, the dick was too good
It made me feel good for temporary love
You was a temporary lover

Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, but I need you
 
 
 
Real niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning it's more, you see right through walls
Ain't talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come with me, Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy, y'know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me, hey, ayy, hey

Niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it—pussy
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it—pussy
Double back handicap and go blind for it—pussy
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculating and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the code names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
Solána, middle fingers up, speak your truth

You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (pussy)
I know what you really 'bout
High key, your *beep* is weak buddy
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute
We ain't feelin' you
I think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, SZA)
I'm really tryna crack off on the headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
'Cause if you that for me

Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy, like doves in the wind, hey, hey

Unfortunately you couldn't get your shit together
(Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride)
(Ride, ride, ride, ride)
You are now watching MADtv

We take things, and my influence so far, and then it's out of my hands. And, y'know, while as I said it can be scary, it can also be a little bit comforting. Because I've learned that when I get to that point, and I can acknowledge, "Okay, Audrey, that's as much as you can do," I can 
actually
 let i
t 
go

Ripping the heads off all my Barbie dolls
Toss them to the side, get the convertibles
(Click, vroom) I like the way it rides up
Ken had it all, Skipper wanted more than
Watching from the sidelines, wish that she had it
She wish that she had it

Here in your backyard, building a fantasy
Fuck reality, do you want to know, know me
Do you want to know me?

Stuck in Nintendo, you're the controller
Street Fighters and such
I yelled "finish him"
(Down goes Frazier)
I yelled "finish him"
Come Desdemona, Othello and tragedies
Shakespearean sorrows,
 
where do I begin?
Where do we begin?

I got L's on my record
Weed on the vinyl
Keys open doors when them keys is albino
Now knock on my door
 
when my stars is a Lionel
I've been fishing for a minute, for a minnow
Only I know that a pawn is a trade
And a rookie for a castle like tuition for a final
Playing hooky for a tassel, spend a minute on the minor
Wins on my window
Ash on my skin, when the record low temps for the wind blow
Only write rhythm to the tardiest of tempos
Only ride shotgun when the car is a limo
Y'ar see
I crowd surf in a cypher
Scuba in my shower,
 
take an Uber to my neighbors
Used to pay the piper, till Peter picked it better
Now the first thing you should tell is where the hell is all the paper
But memories keep coming back
All the nights that we used to laugh
Wanna know how I used to was, how I used to was

Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
(Here in your backyard, building a fantasy)
Just wonder how I used to was, how I used to was
(Fuck reality, do you want to know, know me)
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
(Do you want to know me?)
Just wonder how I used to was, how I used to was
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
Just wondering how I used to was, how I used to was
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
Just wondering how I used to was, how I used to was
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
Just wondering how I used to was, how I used to was
 
 
 
Hey love, I lost you babe
Picking up a penny with a press-on is
Easier than holding you down
Can't be any harder than holding you up now
To come clean I said
(To come clean is to come clean)
To be real is to be real, it's
Probably true what they say about me
Probably came from my inner circle
It usually come from your inner circle
Or lack thereof and I don't know who I can trust
I've been dropping out and
I've been hanging out with my high friends
And we too stoned to pay attention, now
(Much too cool for 7th grade)
I mean really, it's same me, it's old me
You know? Same shit
I've been on the low key grinding
(Grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding)
Learning on the low key, shining
Tryin' to keep to myself
But you bring me out of character
Every time again

Damn Gina, damn Gina
Them jeans, they must be uptight mama
You need some get right mama
(Still works for me, it works for me, no)

Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

I can't recall the last time I took, advice from anyone
Shaped like a figure eight, who trusts pretty girls anyway?
And I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyway? Not me
Are you hating yourself? Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?

Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired (of) always making amends? Oh
I know you hate me now (Here)
I bet you hate me now (Here)
Bring on the thorny crown (Here)
Crucify me

Cross my heart then I hope to die
With a peace of mind (A peace of mind)
Piece together my brain
Soon as this beat rewind (Beat rewind)
Nitrogen and propane
I spike your drink at times (Turn up, turn up)
I make it hard to swallow this game
You throw up every line (Every line)
I notice people got Napoleon complexes
That's my confession (Yeah, that)
You said that we're equal but I know you're beyond guessing
That I'm beyond desperate (Yeah, that)
6AM on a Friday morning, my darkest hours
Them heartless hours, my apartment is lost in a coffin
I'm dead to the world like I popped me a couple downers
Down & Out on my luck
Salt water all on my tux and I call, she don't pick up
Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean, there's no pretending
I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended, that's life
That's you, this me, that vice
You're wrong, I'm right, that's right
I belong somewhere on ice
I'm cold, and my new blood type?
Even colder,
 
cold shoulder
Born Sinner, you know? Cole showed us!
I have nothing to lose
My dark side been well in-tuned
A Gemini gon' show them faces
And this here just one of my moods, Babylon

Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

I'm really over the cryin' thing, wipin' my tears
Who cries anyway? Spread like disease all over me
We did ungodly ghastly things, last night I mean
Who's God anyway? You're mine any day
It's burning, take me
I wanna feel your power, this final hour, tell me
Are you losing yourself? Will you lose it for me?
Are you losing yourself?

Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (Here)
I bet you hate me now (Here)
Bring on the thorny crown (Here)
Crucify me

Crucify, cru-crucify me

How you ain't say you was movin' forward?
Honesty hurts when you're gettin' older
I gotta say I'll miss the way you need me, yeah
Why you ain't say you was gettin' bored?
Why you ain't say I was fallin' short?
How you lead me out so far away?

How could it be?
20 something, all alone still
Not a thing in my name
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Only know fear
That's me, Ms. 20 Something
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Wish you were here, oh

Stuck in them 20 somethings, stuck in them 20 somethings
Good luck on them 20 somethings, good luck on them 20 somethings
But God bless these 20 somethings
(God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh)
Hopin' my 20 somethings won't end
Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends
Prayin' the 20 somethings don't kill me, don't kill me

Weird, took us so long to separate
I feel, it's permanent like a riptide, this time
Waves crashing fast, I try
Think of the past, please stay
How could it be?

How could it be?
20 something, all alone still
Not a phone in my name
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Only know fear
That's me, Ms. 20 Something
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Wish you were here, oh

Stuck in them 20 somethings, stuck in them 20 somethings
Good luck on them 20 somethings, good luck on them 20 somethings
But God bless these 20 somethings
(God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh)
Hopin' my 20 somethings won't end
Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends
Prayin' the 20 somethings don't kill me, kill me

(God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh)
(God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh)
(God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh)

And if it's an illusion, I don't want to wake up. I'm gonna hang on to it. Because the alternative is an abyss, is just a hole, a darkness, a nothingness. Who wants that? You know? So that's what I think about control, and that's my story, and I'm stickin' to it
That was beautiful mommy, that was perfect
 
 
 
You love the way I pop my top
Or how I lose my cool
Or how I look at you
Say why?
It ain't no fighting, no I can't stop it
This took a while, yeah
Love the way I pump my fist or how I bust my hip
For your affection, tryna be down
No fighting and no stoppin'
Stick around

Wish I was the type of girl that you take over to mama
The type of girl, I know my daddy, he'd be proud of
Yeah, uh be proud of, yeah
Uh be proud of, uh be proud, you know, you know
Wanna be the type of girl you take home to your mama
The type of girl, I know your fellas they'd be proud of
Uh be proud of, uh be proud of, uh be proud of, boy you know

Normal girl, oh
I wish I was a normal girl, oh my
How do I be, how do I be your baby?
Normal girl, oh, oh, oh
I wish I was a normal girl
I'll never be, no, never be uh, oh

You like it, when I be, aggressive
You like when I say to you
"Get it if you got it, I'm ready and waitin' for it
I'm callin' to put it on," yeah
Like it when I be aggressive
Love when I say to you
"Get it if you want it, I'm waiting, I'm gonna find you
I'm ready to put it on you," yeah, yeah, yeah

Type of girl you wanna take home to mama
Wanna be the type of girl my daddy, he'd be proud of
Uh be proud of, uh be proud of, uh be proud of you know, you know
The type of girl you wanna take her home right up to mama
The kind of girl, I know your fellas, they'd be proud of
I'll be probably, I'll be proud like, I'll be probably a problem, oh, normal girl oh oh oh ahh
(No fantasy, no fantasy)

I really wish a was a normal girl
How do I be, how do I be your baby?
Normal girl, ohhh
I wish I was a normal girl, oh babe
I'll never be, no never be, uh-yeah

This time next year I'll be livin' so good
Won't remember your name, I swear
Livin' so good, livin' so good, livin' so good
This time next year I'll be livin' so good
Won't remember no pain, I swear
Before that you figured out, that I was just a normal girl

Normal girl, what do you say now?
Quit on the world, 'cause it ain't going your way now
Quit on yourself 'cause you can't figure your way out
Normal girl
How do you be?

Quicker than we started, evidence we misaligned
Man, I get more in love (More in love) with you each argument
Somethin' wrong with me, I like the way you screw your face up
Trigger me right when I need it
You wrong, but I can't get along without you
It's a shame and I can't blame myself, keep on lovin' you
You do it different

Don't trip when you see me out, kickin' with my new bitch
I'll still hang around even though you cappin', cappin'
I could pretend you was my main nigga
Bet you love just how that feels (Oh, shit)
Out of my way, you out of pocket, need clear vision, boy (Vision)
Can't trust decision when you near me
Get myself caught in your crossfire
You a wild one, and I'm wading in you like it's cool water
Like it's cool when you pull up boo'd up with a new and it's not me

Fearin' not growin' up
Keepin' me up at night
Am I doin' enough?
Feel like I'm wastin' time

Promise to get a little
Better as I get older
And you're so patient
And sick of waitin'
Promise to do better
Shoulda coulda
Prolly wanna let me go
But you can't, oh
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit

Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please, please
Don't take it personal
Don't take it personal
Darling, like I know you will, ooh

Forget to call your mama on the weekend
You should put yourself in time out
(Shame, shame on you)
But lately you've been feelin' so good
I forget my future, never pull out
(Shame, shame on me)
Baby the money'll make it easier for me
To run and hide out somewhere
(So far away)
Hoppin' through poppy fields
Dodgin' evil witches
These houses keep droppin' everywhere

Promise to get a little
Better as I get older
And you're so patient
And sick of waitin'
Promise to do better
Shoulda coulda
Prolly wanna let me go
But you can't, oh
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Right now it's really pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit

Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please don't take it, take it personal

Like winters fall on us, heavy
Take it off me, all it off
Winter, I can't stand this
Snow is falling all on me
 
 
 
You are but a phoenix among feathers
You're broken by the waves among the sea
They'll let you die, they'll let you wash away
But you swim as well as you fly

Pretty little bird
Pretty little bird
You've hit the window a few times
The window a few times
You're pretty little bird
Pretty little bird
You still ain't scared of no heights
When the spiral down feels as good as the flight
When hating you feels good for the night
When the morning comes I hope you're still mine

When the morning comes
If the morning comes
When the morning comes
If the morning comes
When the morning comes
If the morning comes
When the morning comes
If the morning comes

Told you I like gentle giants so you softened up
And you been jack'n, bean'n, stalk'n just to get to me love
I wanna be your golden goose
I wanna shave my legs for you
I wanna take all of my hair down and let you lay in it
Spread all of my limbs out and let you lay in it

Pretty little birds
Pretty little birds
Do you mean every word you mean, every word?
Pretty little girls
Pretty little girls
We hit the window a few times (the wall)

I can't stay
But I would lay
But I would
I would

Lately I feel like I'm robbin' myself
Like I'm robbin' mines
Diamond cerebral peek into your cortex
Be faithful and free and just play in your vortex
I see you 'Lana, you fly by the pound
Fly by the ounce, fly to the south
Don't mind them bitches that's cleanin' my house
Lord, you can see, lord
You see them heights that they just can't afford
I see them lights and you made for that shit
Fuck all that cryin', you pray for that shit

But my wings don't spread like they used to
But I wanna fly with you
('Til we hit the heavens)
But my wings don't spread like they used to
But I wanna fly with you
('Til we hit the heavens
'Til we hit the heavens)
 
 
 
Hey, hey, glory child, hey

Hey, glory child, don't you worry
Stutterin', shakin' off your fear
Beauty's never given in a hurry
So condescending, leave your questions here
Hey, glory child, don't you worry
I can see your skeleton so clear
Doubting's only made your visions blurry
You're better off just looking in the mirror

Show me a better way, I wish you could
Show me a better way, I wish you would
Come home today
You could come home today

I am shooting stars, don't you see me?
Watching over your every mistake
Digging out of graves is never easy
Handing you my shovel, here to take
Always playing catch-me-if-you-can
Gingerbread—you heard I'm sweet to taste
Close your eyes, let go, and count to ten
I'll keep track of every moment wasted

Show me a better way, I wish you could
Show me a better way, I wish you would
Come home today
You could come home today


Dear God, make me a bird, so I can fly far, far, far away
Dear God, make me a bird, so I can fly far, far, far away
Dear God, make me a bird, so I can fly far, far, far away
Warm winds on a space ride (space ride)
When I call your phone on a late night (late night)
I recall your soul had a taste like (taste like)
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds

The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had a taste like
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm Winds on a space ride

Sometimes I call your name out loud
Just to make sure it's you
Sometimes I crack my veins open
Just to see if it's blue
You clean me up

The clouds below your feet
Clean
Quit clipping on your wings
Our wings, yeah
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
You'll see
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had a taste like...
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm Winds on a space ride

Sometimes I bite my lips and close my eyes
Just to pretend it's you
Long live lonely thoughts on Thursday nights
That's when I think of you
We were all thirteen once (once) Long live tramp stamps and Pepper Ann (Pepper Ann)
You will never judge me for that
You will always love me for that

Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
Whats happening to we?
Warm Winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had taste like
Gardens, flowers
 
 
 
Maybe I should kill my inhibition
Maybe I'll be perfect in a new dimension

Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson ooh

Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do do do down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will

Keepin' up is hard to do
Even harder feeling heavy, steady chasin' you
Beep beep, why are you lookin' around, you lonely?
I feel you comin' down like honey
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I

Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson ooh

Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do do do down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will

Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do you know I'm alive?
Do you even know?
 
 
 
2 A.M. again and I'm thinkin' 'bout
2 A.M. again and I'm thinkin', should I come through?
Can I come kick
Can I come kick with you?
2 A.M. again and I'm thinkin' 'bout
It's 2 A.M. and I'm stuck up thinkin' about the
Last time you were behind me
All in the mirror
I could see everything you would be doin'
I could see everything, lookin' at me like you love me
I know you don't love me
I never care long as I come first, you come on time
I reverse, you rewind, do it again
Stuck in time, do it again

All you ever say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, yeah
You don't ever come, why you never come?
Will you ever come?
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
Why you never come to me, no?
Why you never come to me?
Why you never come to me, no?"

This my time, it's your turn
I know you're right
I know it burns to be in love
I know it burns to be another
One of your girls on the side like that
I know your kind, how you lie like that
I know you're mine when you bite it like that
I know you're mine when you put it like that
Guess you was right when you put it like that
I know now
I get the point, I hear you loud and clear
All this time I've been playin' your side
I could have done better shit with my life
To waste no time on you
Got to move on cause you got me fucked up
I am confused from this point on trust nobody, yeah
Out of my body, blowin' my fuse out
Devil, please cut me loose, yeah, please cut me loose, oh

"Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, yeah
You don't ever come, why you never come?
Will you ever come?
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
Why you never come to me, no?
Why you never come to me?
Why you never come to me, no?"

Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait
For you, you, you, you
You, you
Never, never too late, late, late, late
Late, late, late
Fall through, through, through, through
It's 2 A.M., it's 2 A.M. and I'm on you, you, you, you
Thinkin' 'bout you
You again, you again
Never knew a nigga that I want bad as I want you, baby
It's 2 A.M. and I confess I want you
Bad as I want you, bad as I want you
It's 2 A.M., it's 2 A.M. again

I might be thirsty for you
How can you be blame me?
Oh I might be thirsty for you
How can you be blame me?
Oh I might play circus for you
How do you want me?
I conjure up that coochie for you
Voodoo, Houdini
And I might be that hoochie for you
Do you need me?
 
 
 
I think I'm bad as hell
I got issues, out of line
Sayin' tomorrow I'll get the dishes
Never come
Easy bake, easy wake, oven
Just give as much as you take
Forgive as much as you hate
Or get the fuck out

I've been in the dugout (Dugout)
Lookin' for a way out (Way out)
You know just takin' it slow (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now I'm feeling worn out (Worn out)
Lookin' for a way out (Way out)
Somebody show me the door (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)

I was wavy
I've been waitin' for you, boy
And I was drownin'
Ooh
I went crazy
I've been goin' crazy, boy
Found out, this the way out (Ooh)
Now I'm wavy
Now I'm wavy

You know just takin' it slow babe
Somebody show me the door babe
You know just takin' it slow babe
Somebody show me the ropes, babe
 
 
 
Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking
Foolish of me to think I had it
Emmanuel, how foolish of me!
To think I had it
I hear your voice behind me
Moving up my neck
I hear you talking
Creeping on my shoulder
I hear you breathing
In my head I hear you screaming
Just do it..

Yeah yeah, I feel you talking
Yeah yeah I feel you moving
Yeah yeah let's do it already
Yeah yeah..

Chipping away at boulders
I conquer fire
40 days 40 nights
No New Star
Fuck your Third Eye
I be the One
Neo of the Sun
Give me simplicity
Too lonely, seems like real fun
I feel you
Creeping up my leg I hear you talking
Moving on my shoulder I hear you breathing
In my head I hear you screaming
Just do it

Don't come close
Don't come close
You don't even know me, know me
Don't come close
Don't come close

You don't even know me
You think you know me
Yeah yeah, I feel ya talking

Lyrics from Snippet

He's sus'
Every time you make this all about you

Gettin' tough right now
Feel lost, but I like it
Comforting my sins (Not about me)
It's only tough right now
Feeling days of resentment
Simmer in my skin
There's all of my

Blood stain on my shirt
New bitch on my nerve
Old nigga got curved
Going back on my word
Damn, bitch, you like 
 
 
 
Here soon, here soon
Here soon, here soon

Loving alone is what you make it
(Make it, make it)
Stay for the storm if you can take it
(Take it, take it)
But pray for a raincoat to bare the brunt of mistakes
I know you worry a lot if I’ll be here for you
Do I care enough? Do I feel for you?
I can guarantee

Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh
Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh

And I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more
And I didn’t know you cried 'cause you wanted more
Things don't happen the way you hoped to
I’m just keeping a little hope, baby
And I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more

Dying of daydreams in your bedroom
(Bedroom, bedroom)
Been waiting so long, said you’d be here soon
(Here soon, here soon)
How could you forget that I’m the one who
Forgot all your mistakes and dirty drawers?
You know I care for you
When hell over earth came, 
I stood for you
Will you stand for me?

Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh
Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh

And I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more
And I didn’t know you cried 'cause you wanted more
Things don't happen the way you hoped to
I’m just keeping a little hope, baby
I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more

Here soon, here soon



Funny how life is turning out
I don't have much to talk about
Don’t have much to write about
Got a shitload to cry about
Funny the words I do kick
Funny the niggas I do pick
It’s funny what sticks
(Go figure)
Mama said I’m sensitive
I gotta work on that
Not really
Tired of using adjectives, I gotta build on that
You feel me?
Not really

Young man, tryna hold the world in a broken hand, hand
Young man, tryna find the world in a broken hand
 
 
 
I had a dream last night you gave me a ring
With a fucking castle on it
And a diamond on top, that's all I really wanted
Whoa oh
Whoa
Until two aliens came and chopped both our heads off
With samurai swords
At least we died together, that's what I thought
I woke up huggin' leather, am I out of pocket?

She ain't got no soul
She ain't got no heart
Love will stunt your growth
Love will make it hard to stay sober
So hard to stay sober

I'mma be fine anyway
I'mma be cool
I'mma keep calm
I'mma be right anyway
Better than you, better than her
I'mma be on anyway
I'mma be on/off anyway
I'mma be on/off anyway

I been through like six Swishers
In one day with one grape and one blueberry
What would my mother say? She’d want me to be married
And happy and whole, not high and alone
Whoa, that Xanax make you trip, I still ain't got no whip
I still ain't got no friends
At least I got my family, bullshit
My daddy still can't stand me

That hate don't make you hard
Hate'll make you old
Haters gone too far
Hate is all I know
And I can't stay sober
I can't stay sober
You should see the look on your face

I'mma be fine anyway
I'mma be cool
I'mma keep calm
I'mma be right anyway
Better than you, better than her
I'mma be on anyway
I'mma be on/off anyway
I'mma be on/off anyway

Just can't stay sober
I'm just trying to stay alive
I can't stay sober
I'm just trying to stay alive
I can't stay sober, I
Alive
I don't know man
 
 
 
Go forth, spread the news
I'm liberated
Go on, cut the rope
I know you hate it
Two knives, no fork
Wonder who'd make it?
I lose for you, I choose for you

Gun fighting
Fatality, boy
Hell fire, boy
I stay for eternity
For you, for you
For you, for you I stay
For you, for you
For you, for you I

Sometimes I keep you in my mind
Sometimes I let you go up high
I'm using everything I find
Do anything to keep you tied up
Tied up

Stationary, birds wings
Small canary, princess
Young savage girl, lost among the lily pads
One road no choice, I've given you this
Move moons for you, I choose to do it

Gun fighting
Fatality, boy
Hell fire, boy
I stay for eternity
For you, for you
For you, for you I stay
For you, for you
For you, for you I

Sometimes I keep you in my mind
Sometimes I let you go up high
I'm using everything I find
Do anything to keep you tied up
Tied up
 
 
 
Jesus called me collect last night
It took all of me not to answer
Daddy warned me the perils of playing
Hard to get with God as in standard
Flying high and fearless baby
I've kissed death a thousand times before

Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November
Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November

Take (take) time (time)
Flow (flow) shine (shine)
Brilliant (brilliant) light (light)
Angel (angel) fly (fly)

Heard you fucking with Tommy again
We both 'member where that landed you last time
That nigga don't really love you girl
He just beds you every night, it's his past-time
Blind eye and the fearless, darling
You two might just do it raw tonight
Heaven help if he leave you girl
I bet you bought two new thongs this time

Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November
Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November

Hurts right, broken stride
 
 
 
Should I assume you didn't mean it like that?
Or should I assume you know exactly how you said it?
You know exactly how you meant it
Should I assume it's me, sweet disposition
Switchin' position, duckin' submission
Or should I assume it's a weekend thing, boy?
You could get ass all week, droppin' that ass
Just think about me, think about me

And it sounds good, what's the difference if it sound good?
Split the difference if it's still good
What's the difference if it's still good
Just not yours exclusively?
Used to be all good
Trade it up, now it's all bad
Rang it up, credit all bad
Getting on, never saw that
Mystery number, call back
It better not be her again
Know you wish it wasn't
Know you wish I wasn't

Ooh-ooh, so hard to love (so hard)
Darling, you make it too hard to trust
You keep running from me
I'm scared of love
Make it easy for me
I wanna be, it's difficult for me
I'm scared of love, yeah
And you're hard to trust
(You keep) why you running from me?
I'm backing up
Make it easy for me
Don't wanna be scared to love

Hopin' you will, hopin' you would
Wish a bitch would
, dissin' me
Hopin' you would, kissin' me
Underneath the constellation
If it's any consolation
If it's worth the conversation
I don't do this all of the time
I just say that every time it's worth the lie
It's worth the crime, it's worth the bad karma
I bet you like it rough
Makin' bad decisions how we beggin', and you love it

All good, what's the difference?
Still good, split the difference
All good, what's the difference if it's still good
Just not yours exclusively?
Used to be all good
All bad
Tell it, love, that's more than

Ooh-ooh, so hard to love (so hard)
Darling, you make it too hard to trust
You keep running from me
I'm scared of love
Make it easy for me
I wanna be, it's difficult for me
I'm scared of love, yeah
And you're hard to trust
(You keep) why you running from me?
I'm backing up
Make it easy for me
Don't wanna be scared to love

Freedom ain't real, who's sold you that lie?

Purity, purity

Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go there
Show me the way to your hiding place

Go to church if you scared

I lay formless
Hands tied in my sheets
Star signs say I'm rare
Chosen
By who
I-I-I-I-I
I wonder who's watchin'
Whose wing I'm under
Sweep me up and I'll go
No questions take me
I'll go!

Show me the way to your hiding place

Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go go go there
Go to church if you scared

Show me the way

Shotgun to the back of my heart, I don't turn around to see who let one ring out
Said you'll never do me wrong? Guess we see how that plays out
Is it true? Is it true?

Heading to the Massacre
Bodies arriving every day
What were those shells you heard
Picking the bones up along the way
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out

Sharpshooter in my backyard
Killed a small boy once, never told no one
If it wasn't for my shotgun, he'd be alive and I'd be halfway, to heaven
Instead of sitting in the dark, going through hell you should've been here
Wish you had been here

Heading to the Massacre
Bodies arriving every day
What were those shells you heard
Picking the bones up along the way
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Shotgun to the back of my heart, I don't turn around to see who let one ring out

Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
I got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na-na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat-flat
And your ass on "What's that?"
And, yeah, I need it all right now

You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up

Girl, you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah, I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood, I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet?

I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)

DJ Khaled!

Uhh, I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like "what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?"
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "Fuck it, I’m on one"

I’m burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya "everything is great"
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "fuck it, I’m on one"

I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say "cheese" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel tov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence
(Young Mula baby, YMCMB)

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young

I took the top off the Maybach, yeah
I, I took the top off my Maybach, nigga
I took the top off my Maybach

I chopped the top off in Otis
Ridin' 'round town with the FLOTUS
One-point-five for the Landaulet
Bey, put these fuckboys on notice (Fuckboys on notice)

How I'm the only lady here, still the realest nigga in the room?
I break the internet, top two and I ain't number two
My body, my ice, my cash, all real, I'm a triple threat
Fuck it up and then leave, come back, fuck it up and leave again
Top off the coupe and it look like Freaknik
In the hood, hollerin', "Free Meek"
Two deep, it's just me and Jay
Just posted in them courtside seats
Woo, I'm like, "hol' up"
Woo, I might roll up
If they're tryna party with the queen
They gon' have to sign a non-disclosure, ayy

I took the top off the Maybach, yeah
I took the top off the Maybach (Ain't gon' stop)
I took the top off the Maybach (Rah)
I took the top off the Maybach (Woo, woo)
Ayy, I took the top off of my Maybach, bitch

Ooh-ooh, ooh, it's glittery, glittery
Ooh-ooh, it's pricy, pricy

Ooh-ooh, I'm hyphy, I'm hyphy

I hear the po-po behind me, woo, ain't gon' stop (Skrrt, skrrt)

I see the po-po behind me, skrrt, ain't gon' stop (Skrrt, skrrt)
I dropped the top off the Maybach, 'rrt, fuck these cops ('Rrt, 'rrt)

DJ Khaled

Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key

And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key

Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix

Oh yeah, mhm yeah
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key

Holy, Holy key, holy

I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you

I wanna be where the commas will be
But I need a hood nigga with the llama degree
Get the limited edition, Audemars, it could be
In a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee
'Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips
And he took a couple trips, then it's dinner and a Myx
And he's never with no other chick, fronting like he's slick
'Cause it's levels to this shit, and she could never be Nic
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy
Mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies
Saw the High School video now he wanna play hookie
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst
Ain't never been done, bitch I added this
Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists
'Bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin
Got a big billboard out in Madison
At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson
Got the .22 on me, and it's thin
Shoot movies, Jennifer Aniston

You decide you'll be mine you can come inside
You the type that can make me prioritize
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
You reply, what's your sign? You're a Gemini
You deny that you're shy, maybe we should slide?

Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Everything you do is brand new

Make that bad bitch my shorty, hit the club, throw forty
My hat bent like 'Uhh!', my chain drip like water
Car paint like tar, I'ma sex her harder
Bitch let go my hand gave you the keys as soon as I bought it
Voom, voom, oh yeah, big bank, I'm too real
My money right in them boys you with be dead broke, two years
Checked it, look her, you ain't even know, big deal
On site, act right, I shop hard, pack light
That ho chick gets you no play, all I talk is cocaine
White tee and these rope chains, blow the roof back - Kurt Cobain
Phantom cost like four dollar, flo' seats, hoes holla
Underground with this pimp shit so smoke one for Port Arthur

Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you

Benz or the Rolls, Mulsanne overrated
Half these niggas told, cut a deal, they'd take it
Promise to never fold and the bonds still sacred
Had to shake a couple niggas, everybody won't make it
God is the greatest as I'm prayin' in the latest
X600 as I swerve, Little Haiti
Ou paka bat m'wen, sak pase!

And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay

Uh, I don’t know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain’t even bedtime
And don’t you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder

Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don’t know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you

I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain’t the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga (Work)
With your mind and your heart and your soul (Let's go)
For your goals, in control, you let it go (Work)
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby

Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal

You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day he'll grow up and be a man
And lately you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slipping at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; ¡wuh!)

So amazin' to see, black baguettes in my watch
She say love is for free, just expensive to shop
But it's nothin' to me, uh, that extends from my block (Ugh!)
I got a lot of figures, yeah, I'm a father figure (Me)
She know a lot of niggas, don't know a hotter nigga (Ha!)
Come to the winners circle, a lot of men will hurt you
But I'm here to nurture (For real), I wanna take you further

Yo, reputation for bustin', pussy open, it's nothin'
Big fat nigga, all that huffin' and puffin'
Take me shopping in France and he pay in advance
He got big balls, ran a play in his pants
Ran away with his money just to chill on the Island
All my bitches is stylin', beaches and eatin' Italian
This is real shit, r-r-real shit
On the real, nigga fuckin' with a real bitch
I-I-I ride for him, DMV
Stamina, GNC
3 letters, CMB
Competition, I don't see any

Got my eyes closed, like Asian persuasion
Fuck with me baby, it's Tunechi, baby
Buss a nut, smoke a blunt, now I'm rejuvenated
With all that pink on, bitch, I'm King Kong

DJ Khaled
Hey, yeah
We the best

All I do is win, win, win no matter what (What)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There), 
and they say yeah
 (Yeah)
And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win
And if you going in put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there

Yeah, listen, Luda!
Ludacris goin' in on the verse
'Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now (Woah)
Keep your hands up, get 'em in the sky
For the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down (Woah)
I never went nowhere (No), but they sayin' "Luda's back" (Yeah)
Blame it on that conjure (Ha), the hood call it Luda 'gnac
 (Yah)
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow (Flow)
My hands go up and down (Down), like strippers' booties go (Whoo)
My verses still be servin' (Yup), 
tight like a million virgins
 (Yup)
Last time on the Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
 (Yah)
Can't never count me out (No), y'all better count me in (Yo)
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in (Whoo)
Make millions every year (Yeah) the South's champion (Yeah)
'Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I, all I do is

All I do is win, win , win no matter what 
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building

And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win , win , win 
And if you going in  put your hands in the air , make 'em stay there

Swervin' in my lo-lo
Head on the swivel, 
you know serving me's a no-no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger, they see it they say, "Oh boy"
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me loco
Down for armed trafficking
, don't make me pull that fo'-fo'
Ask you what you laughing at (What?), represent that mud life (Mud life)
Dirty money bitch you better get yo' mud right (Mud right)
We come together holdin' hands and holla 
"Thug life"
 ("Thug Life")
We all strapped in all black, it's like fuck life (Fuck life) 
You riding to what  'cause we riding tonight 
Now she riding with me 'cause you wasn't riding her right
Ross!

All I do is win, win, win no matter what (What)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There), 
and they say yeah
 (Yeah)
And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win
And if you going in put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there

Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water gettin' boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I been running this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of 'em,
 bust 'til I burst 'em up
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, 
Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me, I'm bossing up, pressure up, bless you bruh
Don't mess with us, we like the U in the 80's
Back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track, bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, "Just win baby, win"

All I do is win, win, win no matter what (What)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There), 
and they say yeah
 (Yeah)
And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win
And if you going in put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there
 
 
 
Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic
DJ Khaled!

A divine leader, shine brighter, bonita mami meeter
Line sniffer, never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer
Ebony empress getter
Celebrity Apprentice
 a devil show, big up to Africa, Mexico
Hennessy, margarita,
 
venison eater
So dear, spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either
Dome me, relax me, it's only to the nasty
I'm just a phony assassin
, 
a lot of niggas owe me, I'ma tax 'em
A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic
‘Cause the rosary and gold flashy
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco
Last time I checked I was still breathin', my neck was still freezin'
Now everybody got an Escobar Season
To every baby on the album cover existin'
This trend I was settin', it came to fruition
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward
To all my ghost supporters, go support us
Like a local Black-owned grocery store
‘Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
It's a dub on that, we get government aid
Spend it at they stores, puttin' they kids through college
We need balance so we can lease and own deeds in our projects
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets
The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it

My signature fade with the Bevel blade, that's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that, that's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself, that's a major key
What Tony had on the table, it's like us, we a major key

Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson
Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards
Up in the heavens maybe
It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately
I'm playin' chess with babies, niggas is nursery
Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me
Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly
So official, come get this issue, some women crazy
I like a woman to show me wisdom
These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy
With a loaded pistol; y'all ain't meant to be played
Says the brother with the signature fade
Still paid, stackin', new stash
Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers
To computer hackers
, 
check the fashion in Monaco
Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats
Khaled called me when I was in album mode
So I put it on hold for the 
Major Key
My album done, niggas, wait and see

Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic

My signature fade with the Bevel blade, that's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that, that's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself, that's a major key
What Tony had on the table, it's like us, we a major key

This shit's special

And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories—she right there
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind, so I can't sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now, the only way I see the broad is online
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to kill you
I built my whole life around you
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel? I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the Sweets, I
Realize some things never change
Once in love and it's gone, you don't look at it the same, man
Fuck love, 'cause she don't live here
I'm soaked in blood, but I'm still here
Hip-hop heartbreaks
Straight-laced, deep bass, 808s, plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feeling like I up and let you—
Get away, now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the colleges, professors
Now, I regret the day I met ya (Bitch)
I'll be the first one to say it
She ain't the one you want to play with
I fucked hip-hop

And if— And if— And if— And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I can give to her
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason,
 
Dr. Dre, O'Shea
And a host of those who passed away
Today, I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you want to rap—to this bitch, you must commit
Then you're a slave to your grave, you won't get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her Vibe covers keep you warm
But the source to her heart is love—word up, right on
You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her WorldStar
Kissing on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings
Made some friends resent me for writing about my life
They thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would've never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I'll ever be the same, ugh, hallowed be Thy name
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry
But I tried her, used to ride her—for dollars, not for fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second
Then, I screamed, "She's dead!"
And everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just looking out for my music family
Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours
You can have her—she's a motherfucking whore
I fuck hip-hop

And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I would I give to her
She ain’t the one you wanna play with
You say you wanna rap, to this bitch you must commit
I fucked hip-hop
And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most I can give to her
She ain’t the one you wanna play with
I fuck hip-hop
And you all know how the story go

This shit's special

Can't call it, can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, yeah, I can't call it

Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

Tables do turn and labels do burn
The second they ask you to sell your soul
Don't you do it, don't you fold, say "Fuck that shit" and be bold
Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold
And if you never go gold again, at least you would know
The end of your road was chose, by you and not companies
Who control our remote control, and hide the truth on my no
But don't mind me, I'm just high again
Smokin' weed to get by again
No, actually I'm lyin' 'cause smokin' ain't got me smilin'
And rhyming like I rhyme way back when I would play the violin
Thought that shit wasn't cool
Momma sorry, I just stopped tryin' it
Paid for your house in hopes, there'd be no more reason for cryin'
That shows you how stupid I am 'cause niggas is out here dying
From police that flash the siren and pull up and just start firin'
Niggas murkin' each other in murky water, I try and swim
How the fuck do I look when I brag to you 'bout some diamond?
Said all that I could say, now I play with thoughts of retirement

Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

Can't call it, can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, yeah, I can't call it

I talk gray, I don't keep it white and black

Sometimes, other times I'd love to have you back
Can't think of a night that we ain't turn up to the max
To the max, no

One, two, them boys coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, hide your bitch
(Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit!)

They said "thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real"
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas hot for real
Every year gon' be our year, every year gon' be my year
These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
The block is at war, post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over In God We Trust
We believe in God, but do God believe in us?
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know him?
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen

I’ve been poppin' shit for too long
But still reppin’ where I came from
I guess it’s how I came up
I wish you would try to play us

I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga

We fly, them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar?
Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters

Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
I’m at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters
All my niggas still hustle, consider ‘em roguish
I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus
All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quoting
Hunh, my corner will scorch ya, somehow my flow is the coldest
Money, power, respect, the only things truly important
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
God Forgives and I Don’t, pussy niggas on notice

I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga

You just got home nigga, you tryna live nigga
You don’t wanna do another 5 years nigga
The boss is testing yo ass, the feds’ll question yo ass

We The Best music
DJ Khaled

Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

Look, look
My granny 88, she had my uncle and then
A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves

Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)

But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)

They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher 


Emptied out the clip, it was broad day
Fuck niggas always gotta learn the hard way
We gon' tape it off if we ball play
Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves but it was God's grace
Crooked ass whoever 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake
South Central state of mind, high crime rate 
Homicide, hate, gang banging'll get you all day 
And look at my fate

Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)

But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

Higher
Oh, Lord
Can you feel it?
My shoes are scrapin' the sky
I'm so high
We keep goin' higher

Another one
DJ Khaled

Back against the wall, middle fingers in the air
Busting through the crowd, they gon' feel me now
Straight shooter from the hip, yeah, we heavy in here
Tell me get ’em, then I got 'em, yea (Get 'em)
99 problems, but you ain’t one
Been so high lately, I don't care who's goin' down
You could see it in my eyes, he been hitting it right
Got me wishing that he wasn't, oh no
And I need it all night
Will love show me what it feels like?
Fuck that, I let you pull up on me broad day light
Shots over here, fuck the other side
We don't gotta lay low, we grown
A field trip and I don't need no chaperone
I'm tryna get ghost
Oh, oh (Another one)

It’s just us against the world
In this life of sin
Ain’t nobody gonna take us out
It's always us, never them
It’s just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, never them

It's lovely at the top, private destination
Sippin' on the rocks, only way with us
This kinda love dangerous when there’s nothing else to lose
So don't make me wild out (Let's ride)
Got 99 problems, what's one more?
50 feet get you touched at your front door
Livin' fast and we spending slow
Side eyes let me know that we visible
And I need it right now (Yeah)
Ten toes down, show me what it's all about
Thuggin', we only duckin' when the boys come out
It's us over them, fuck the other side
We gonna turn the lights off, we hard
What we doin', don't nobody gotta know
I ain't tryna get ghost, oh yes
Oh, oh

It's just us against the world
In this life of sin
Ain't nobody gonna take us out
It's always us, never them
It's just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, never them

This how an angel sounds (No, no, do-do)
It's just, uh, it's just us, it's just us
It's just us
It's always us, it's always us
It's only us
It's just us, it's just us, it's just us
It's always, it's always us, it's always us

It's just us against the world
In this life of sin (Yeah)
Ain't nobody gonna take us out
It's always us, never them (Yeah, yeah)
It's just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, never them

You're all that I need, ooh, yeah
It's just, uh, it's just us, it's just us
We The Best Music
It's always, it's always us, it's always us
It's just us, it's just us, it's just us
Another one
It's always, it's always us, it's always
 
 
 

Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody 
(nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surroundings when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dog's got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pane to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures say them words we ain't trying to stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm stunned thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For the money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families, these motherfuckers ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepare for the payback cause it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable
He fuck around, jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
To really figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything,
 skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites, that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, no chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
You was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kits, old Schnitzer's
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh ohh
There's a story in me

Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't into making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action, they grab him, he take the stand
Damn, say loyalty make a man
Got a homie and he told, I don't even shake his hand
I don't even crack a smile, knew him since a child
Man this game so foul but niggas made vows
To a code I never break, ridin' in the heavyweight
Thirty-six O's in a bird, call it featherweight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved, they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on, clip full
If he got the money, we attack him like a pit bull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I know)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day

'Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you, which I will never do)

Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around 
(nobody's around)
Cold world 
(cold world)
 cold world 
(mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close
Are the ones that'll take you down (always take you down)
Cold world 
(cooooold)
 a cold cold world

'Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you)
Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you, which I will never do)

Ohh-ohhh ohhh-whooooa
Ohh-ohhhh 
(ohh-ohhhh)
 ohh-ohhhhh

See there's a story in my life 
(hey)
 
(surrender)
There's a story in my pain 
(hey)
 
(surrender)
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh ohh 
(surrender)
There's a story in me
I won't surrender, I won't surrender, ohh no no no
